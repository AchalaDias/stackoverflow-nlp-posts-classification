How to implement query searching in a specific cluster after document clustering?,"<p>I have two clusters as a class which has </p>

<pre><code>Cluster : class

DocumentList : List&lt;Document&gt;
centroidVector : Map&lt;String,Double&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now the problem is that when the query is searched it is parsed as a file and then made into a document object , added to documentIndex and its index is constructed along with other documents . I did that because it had to go through the same procedure i.e tokenizing ,stemming etc. But now i want to implement query search in a specific cluster with which the query vector is most similar with , i.e dot product ~ 0.5 -1 . So i would have to take a dot product between the query vector and the cluster vector to do that. But i dont know how to implement it because the index is created in memory and is not stored in the database. Still in the process of doing that .</p>

<p>Thank you </p>
","machine-learning, nlp, cluster-analysis","<p>Clustering is not meant for <em>searching</em> (i.e. indexing etc.). It is an analysis step meant to <em>find</em> possible unknown structure within your data set, not to retrieve information faster.
You can exploit the structure <em>sometimes</em> for faster search, but then you need an index that can make use of this.</p>

<p>Just do an index right away if you want to do similarity search! Then try to improve the index by doing some clustering before.</p>

"can NLTK/pyNLTK work &quot;per language&quot; (i.e. non-english), and how?","<p>How can I tell NLTK to treat the text in a particular language?</p>

<p>Once in a while I write a specialized NLP routine to do POS tagging, tokenizing and etc. on a non-english (but still hindo-European) text domain.</p>

<p>This question seem to address only different corpora, not the change in code/settings:

","python, nlp, nltk","<p>I'm not sure what you're referring to as the changes in code/settings. NLTK mostly relies on machine learning and the ""settings"" are usually extracted from the training data.</p>

<p>When it comes to POS tagging the results and tagging will be dependant on the tagger you use/train. Should you train your own you'll of course need some spanish / polish training data. The reason these might be hard to find is the lack of gold standard material publicly available. There are tools out there to do that do this, but this one isn't for python (<a href=""http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.ims.uni-stuttgart.de/projekte/corplex/TreeTagger/</a>). </p>

Extract terminology from sentences quickly,"<p>I am working in Text Mining and my work is focused on biomedical entities (genes, proteins, drugs and diseases). I would like to share with you some questions.</p>

<p>Now, my goal is to find biomedical entities in biomedical text (from Medline) and through of dictionaries of terms, I can identify each entity found with its unique identifier.</p>

<p>To store text, dicitionaries and results, I am using MongoDB (a nonSQL database). Each abstract is splitted in sentences, and each sentence is store in a new record (with list of tokens, chunks and Part-of-Speech tags). To find entities, I get all senteces and for each one I create a regular expresion for each term in the dictionary (in Python):</p>

<pre><code>for term in dicitonary:
     matches = re.finditer(r'(' + term + ')', sentence)
     for m in matches:
          ini = m.start()
          end = m.end()
          result.append(ini, end, dictionary.get_identification[term])
</code></pre>

<p>But it is really slow, I have several subsets of 150,000 abstracts (>1,000,000 of sentences).</p>

<p>For me, it is really interesting soft-matching to extract more entities where their terminology is not exactly in my dictionary, but it can increase my running time.</p>

<p>I think that my problem is to do a lot of regular expressions (I have dictionary with 300,000 entries) for each sentence, because I have to find the terms in sentence. Without Machine Learning algorithm, how could you resolve this problem? And with ML algorithms? Now, I am flexible to change my programming language, databases...</p>

<p>Thank you very much!!!</p>

","python, machine-learning, nlp, nltk","<p>Take a look at <a href=""http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch06.html"" rel=""nofollow"">chapter 6</a> of the NLTK book. From what you have described, it sounds like a supervised classification technique based on feature (""characteristic"") extraction might be a good choice. From the book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A classifier is called supervised if it is built based on training
  corpora containing the correct label for each input.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You can use some of the data that you have manually encoded to train your classifier. It might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>def word_features(name):
    features = {}
    features[""firstletter""] = name[0].lower()
    features[""lastletter""] = name[-1].lower()
    for letter in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
        features[""count(%s)"" % letter] = name.lower().count(letter)
        features[""has(%s)"" % letter] = (letter in name.lower())
    return features
</code></pre>

<p>Next you can train your classifier on some of the data you have already tagged:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt; words = [('Rock', 'Physical Object'), ('Play', 'Action'), ... ]
&gt;&gt;&gt; featuresets = [(word_features(n), g) for (n,g) in words]
&gt;&gt;&gt; train_set, test_set = featuresets[500:], featuresets[:500]
&gt;&gt;&gt; classifier = nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train(train_set)
</code></pre>

<p>You should probably train on half of the data you already tagged. That way you can test the accuracy of the classifier with the other half. Keep working on the features until the accuracy of the classifier is as you desire.</p>

<pre><code>nltk.classify.accuracy(classifier, test_set)
</code></pre>

<p>You can check individual classifications as follows:</p>

<pre><code>classifier.classify(word_features('Gold'))

","python, nlp, nltk","<p>NLTK classifiers can work with any key-value dictionary. I use <code>{""word"": True}</code> for text classification, but you could also use <code>{""contains(word)"": 1}</code> to achieve the same effect. You can also combine many features together, so you could have <code>{""word"": True, ""something something"": 1, ""something else"": ""a""}</code>. What matters most is that your features are consistent, so you always have the same kind of keys and a fixed set of possible values. Numeric values can be used, but the classifier isn't smart about them - it will treat numbers as discrete values, so that 99 and 100 are just as different as 1 and 100. If you want numbers to be handled in a smarter way, then I recommend using scikit-learn classifiers.</p>

Python: Clustering Search Engine Keywords,"<p>Python: Clustering Search Engine Keywords </p>

<p>Hi,
I have a CSV, up to 20,000 rows (I have had 100,000+ for different websites), each row containing a referring keyword (i.e.  a keyword someone typed into a search engine to find the website in question), and a number of visits.</p>

<p>What I'm looking to do is cluster these keywords into clusters of ""similar meaning"", and create a hierarchy of the clusters (structured in order of summed total number of searches per cluster).</p>

<p>An example cluster - ""womens clothing"" - would ideally contain keywords along these lines: 
womens clothing, 1000 
ladies wear, 300 
womens clothes, 50 
ladies clothing, 6 
womens wear, 2 </p>

<p>I could look to use something like the Python Natural Language Toolkit: <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.nltk.org/</a> and WordNet, but, I'm guessing that for some websites the referring keywords will be words/phrases that WordNet knows nothing about. For example, if the website is a celebrity website WordNet is unlikely to know anything about ""Lady Gaga"", worse situation if the website is a news website.</p>

<p>So, I'm also guessing therefore that the solution has to be one that looks to use just the source data itself.</p>

extracting English verbs from a given text,"<p>I need to extract all English verbs from a given text and I was wondering how I could do it...
At first glance, my idea is to use regular expressions because all English verb tenses follow patterns but maybe there is another way to do it. What I've thought is simply:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a pattern for every verb tense. I have to distinguish between regular verbs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_verbs) and irregular verbs (http://www.chompchomp.com/rules/irregularrules01.htm) in some way.</li>
<li>Iterate over these patterns and split the text using them (the last word of each substring is supposed to be the verb that gives complete meaning to the sentence, which I need for other purposes -> nominalization)</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think? I guess this isn't an efficient way to do it but I can't imagine another one.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>PS: </p>

<ol>
<li>I have two dictionaries, one for all English Verbs and the other one for all English nouns</li>
<li>The main problem of all this is that the project consists on verb nominalization (is just a uni project), so all the ""effort"" is supposed to be focused in this part, nominalization. In concrete, I follow this model: acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P00/P00-1037.pdf). The project consists on given a text, find all the verbs in that text and propose multiple nominalizations for each verb. So the first step (finding verbs), should be as simple as possible... but I can't use any parser, it's not allowed</li>

","language-agnostic, nlp, stemming, lemmatization","<p>It really depends on what you mean by 'programmatically'.  Part of English works on easy to understand rules, and part doesn't. It has to do mainly with frequency. For a brief overview, you can read Pinker's ""Words and Rules"", but do yourself a favor and don't take the whole generative theory of linguistics entirely to heart. There's a lot more empiricism there than that school of thought really lends to the pursuit.</p>

<p>A lot of English can be statistically lemmatized.  By the way, stemming or lemmatization is the term you're looking for.

You can give this a shot if you have a project that requires this type of simplification of strings which represent specific terms in English.</p>

<p>There are even more naive approaches that accomplish much with respect to normalizing related terms. Take a look at the <a href=""http://tartarus.org/~martin/PorterStemmer/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Porter Stemmer</a>, which is effective enough to cluster together <em>most</em> terms in English.</p>

<p>What I wanted to do then, was to compare English sides of the pairs, find the common words that appear in both files (EnWord1,EnWord3, and EnWord4) and filter out their corresponding translations.
In short, I can say that using two bilingual English-Arabic and English French dictionaries, I am trying to build a 3-lingual English-Arabic-French dictionary.</p>

<p>Steve answered me and wrote a nice code to find duplicated English words and remove others and their translations: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11141345/1265960"">The answer could be found here</a></p>

<p>But I still have a bit more complicated question:
What should I do, if I want to add another language? I mean that I have another English-Russian dictionary (Say File5.txt contains English entities, and File6.txt contains Russian entities) and I want to build a 4-language dictionary instead of a 3-language one.</p>

<p>one way is to build a 3-language dictionary using the current code, and then by rerunning it on a new language pair, build a 4-language dictionary. but I think it is not efficient enough, and it would be better solution to this problem. It also may bring in some inconsistencies in other languages.
My main challenge is checking the duplications: when have just 2 language pairs, it would be very easy to check the duplications. But what should I do if I want to check the duplications in 3 pairs?
How can I change the code to be able to extract 4language dictionary in just one pass?</p>
","linux, perl, text, nlp","<p>I'll describe a generic approach that I would use in this task.</p>

<p>1) define <code>%dictionary</code> hash. Each key of this hash would be an English word, and each value would be, in turn, a reference to another hash containing that word' translations. Something like this:</p>

<pre><code>my %dictionary = ( 
  'EnWord1' =&gt; { 
     arabic =&gt; 'Arabic EnWord1', 
     french =&gt; 'French EnWord1',
     ...
  },
  ...
);
</code></pre>

<p>(this hash will be empty before we start processing files, I'm just showing a structure here).</p>

<p>2) Scan each pair of files simultaneously, add a corresponding record to this hash. There's a simple approach:</p>

<pre><code>my %filenames = (
  'arabic' =&gt; ['File1.txt', 'File2.txt'],
  'french' =&gt; ['File3.txt', 'File4.txt'],
  ...
);

for my $lang (keys %filenames) {
  open my $efh, '&lt;', $filenames{$lang}[0] or die $!, ""\n"";
  open my $tfh, '&lt;', $filenames{$lang}[1] or die $!, ""\n"";
  while (&lt;$efh&gt;) {
    chomp(my $enLine = $_);
    chomp(my $trLine = &lt;$tfh&gt;);
    $dictionary{$enLine}{$lang} = $trLine;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>3) Refine <code>%dictionary</code>: leave only those elements, which have translations defined in all languages scanned...</p>

<pre><code>my $proper_translations_count = scalar keys %filenames;
for my $word (keys %dictionary) {
  my $translations = $dictionary{$word};
  if (scalar keys %$translations != $translations_count) {
    delete $dictionary{$word};
  }
}

Phrase corpus for sentimental analysis,"<p>Good day,
I'm attempting to write a sentimental analysis application in python (Using naive-bayes classifier) with the aim to categorize phrases from news as being positive or negative.
And I'm having a bit of trouble finding an appropriate corpus for that.
I tried using ""General Inquirer"" (http://www.wjh.harvard.edu/~inquirer/homecat.htm) which works OK but I have one big problem there.
Since it is a word list, not a phrase list I observe the following problem when trying to label the following sentence:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>He is not expected to win.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This sentence is categorized as being positive, which is wrong. The reason for that is that ""win"" is positive, but ""not"" does not carry any meaning since ""not win"" is a phrase.
Can anyone suggest either a corpus or a work around for that issue?
Your help and insight is greatly appriciated. </p>

<ol>
<li><p>I have a huge list of street names in Indonesia ( > 100k rows ) stored in database,

<li><p>have a bunch of texts ( > 1 Million rows ) in databases, that I split into sentences. Now, the features  ( function to be exact ) that I need to do , is to test whether there are street names inside the sentences or no, so just a  true / false test</p>

<p>I have tried to solve it by doing these steps:</p></li>
</ol>

<p>a. Putting the street names into a Key,Value Hash</p>

<p>b. Split each sentences into words</p>

<p>c. Test whether words are in the hash</p>

<p>This is fast, but will not work with multiple words</p>

<p>Another alternatives that I thought of is to do these steps:</p>

<p>a. Split each sentences into words</p>

<p>b. Query the database with LIKE statement ( i,e. SELECT #### FROM street_table WHERE name like '%word%' )</p>

<p>c. If query returned a row, it means that the sentence contains street names</p>

<p>Now, this solution is going to be a very IO intensive. </p>

<p>So my question is ""What is the most efficient way to do this test"" ? regardless of the programming language. I do this in python mainly, but any language will do as long as I can grasp the concepts</p>

","php, text-mining, information-extraction, nlp","<p>Since your existing metric seems to bias towards shorter phrases, you should consider factoring in bigrams into the mix. So instead of considering scores for just individual words, additionally consider the score for consecutive pairs of words as well (e.g. 'nivea deo', deo roll-on', 'roll-on dry', etc). When computing the score for each title, factor in the scores for every unigram and bigram you can generate out of the title together, but maybe give the bigrams more weight, and this should encourage your algorithm to prefer longer phrases.</p>

<p>If you have large existing corpus of lots of names like these at your disposal, consider using something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%2aidf"">TF-IDF</a><br>
What you are doing right can be likened to just using TF. Using your global corpus, you can compute the idf of each unigram and bigram, which is basically a measure of unique or rare a word or phrase is across the entire corpus.<br>
tf = the number of times you have seen an ngram within these results<br>
idf = a global measure of how unique an ngram might be across all results (or atleast a very large number of them)<br>
So when computing the score for a title, instead of simply adding up the tf's of each ngram in it, you add up the tf*idf of each ngram instead. Rarer ngrams (which possibly do a better job at distinguishing this item from all other items) have a higher idf, so your algorithm should give higher weight to them. A lot of junk terms (like Mindestabnahme) would have really high idf, but they would have a really small tf, so they might not make a big difference. Alternatively prune off tokens you see fewer than k times, to get rid of noise.  </p>

<p>Another NLP trick to know about is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"">Levenshtein distance</a> .. which is a way to quantify how similar two strings are. You can compute the levenshtein distance between every pair of strings within your results, and then try preferring the result which has the lowest average distance from all the other strings. This might not work well by itself... but factoring this score in with your existing approach might help you navigate some tricky cases.  </p>

"Translation of Single Words, Taking into Account Context, using Computer Language Processing Tools","<p>I would like to automatically annotate texts for learners of foreign languages with translations of difficult words.</p>

<p>For instance, if the original text is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>El gato esta en la casa de mis vecinos</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Becomes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>El gato esta en la casa de mis <strong>vecinos</strong> (<em>neighbours</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first step is to identify which words are the difficult ones. This could be done by lemmatization of the words in the original text and comparing them with a list of 'easy words' (a basic vocabulary of 1500-2000 words). Those not found in this list will be designated as 'hard words.' This process seems straightforward enough using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for Python.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty in words that must be translated as a pair, such as 'newly weds,' or phrasal verbs 'he <strong>called</strong> me <strong>up</strong>' or the German 'er <strong>ruft</strong> mich <strong>an</strong>' (anrufen). Here words can't be treated individually. For phrasal verbs and the like perhaps some understanding of grammer is needed.</p>

<p>The second step involves obtaining a correct translation of the difficult words according to context in which they appear. As I understand, this is effectively applying the first half of a statistical machine translation system like google translate. I believe this problem could solved using the Google Translate Research API, that lets you send text to be translated, and the response includes information about which word in the translation corresponds to which word in the original text. So you could feed in the whole sentence and then fish out the word you wanted from the response. You have to apply to use this API however, and they have usage limits, which would likely be a problem for my application. I would rather find another solution. I expect no solution will give 100% correct translations and they will have to be checked by hand, but this should still speed things up.</p>

I've looked at several parsers, but they all seem to do the disambiguation step themselves, which (from my end) is counterproductive.  I'm looking for something off the shelf that (ideally) gives me a one-command way to turn up this information.  </p>

<p>Does such a thing exist?  If not, is there an existent dictionary containing this information that's trivially machine parseable?    </p>

Java: How to Integrate Other Software,"<p>I've always been impressed by the StackOverflow hive mind, and was hoping you could point me in the right direction here.</p>

<p>I've taken some courses in Java programming, and understand how to write a fairly complex Java program. However, I've never learned how to integrate others' software into my own programs.</p>

<p>For a new project, I'd like to integrate a <a href=""http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/POS"" rel=""nofollow"">part-pf-speech tagger</a> and <a href=""http://cogcomp.cs.illinois.edu/page/download_view/Chunker"" rel=""nofollow"">chunker</a> into my code, but have no idea how to ""load"" these programs (if load is the correct term).</p>

<p>I'm certainly not looking for step-by-step instructions, but rather a guide for how to go about this sort of issue. If anyone could get me started in the right direction, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Adam</p>
","java, nlp, integration","<p>It looks like the externals you want to use are themselves in Java. This means you're in luck - you can use pure java language features to make it work.</p>

<p>There are two things to it:</p>

<p>1) your source files that interact directly with the external libraries have to be imported, or otherwise you'll have to refer to them using the fully qualified classname. 
Importing is done with the <code>import</code> statement. These statements should appear right before your class declaration, like so:</p>

<pre><code>import foo.*;       //import all classes from the package foo
import foo.bar.Baz; //import only the Baz class from the package foo.bar

public class MyClass {
    Baz myBaz = null;               //declare a member of type Baz class from package foo.bar
    foo.bar.BazBaz myBazBaz = null; //by using a fully qualified classname, I didn't need to write an import statement for foo.bar.BazBaz  
}
</code></pre>

<p>2) when you compile your sources, the java compiler needs to know where to look for classes you referenced in your source. This is done via the classpath. </p>

<p>The classpath can be a list of just .class files (compiled java classes), but also .jar files (java archives) and .zip files. Typically a project will package all classes it needs in one or more .jar files. </p>

<p>The location of these classes have no bearing on the way you interact with them in java code. It's the compiler's job to read these jars and class files and locate the classes you referred to in your code. If the compiler can't locate the classes you're referring to, you will get a compile time error and you can't compile your program.</p>

<p>You can specify the classpath as an argument to the java compiler command line (http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html#options). However, this becomes unwieldy very rapidly. </p>

<p>Instead, you should use a build tool like <code>ant</code> to do this work for you. The best way to get started is to read this page: <a href=""http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://ant.apache.org/manual/index.html</a>. </p>

<p>From there, go to ""Using apache ant"" and then to ""Writing a simple build file"" in its entirety, they explain how to set up the classpath very well there.</p>

How to do random embedded bracketing of elements,"<p>I'm writing a learning algorithm for automatic constituent bracketing. Since the algorithm starts from scratch, the bracketing (embedded) should be random at first. It is then improved through iterations. I'm stuck with how to do random bracketing. Can you please suggest a code in R or Python or give some programming idea (pseudo code)? I also need ideas on how to check a random bracketing against a proper one for correctness.</p>

<p>This is what I'm trying to finally arrive at, through the learning process, starting from random bracketing.</p>

<p>This is a sentence. 
'He' 'chased' 'the' 'dog.'</p>

<p>Replacing each element with grammatical elements,
N, V, D, N.</p>

<p>Bracketing (first phase) (D, N are constituents):
(N) (V) (D N)</p>

<p>Bracketing (second phase):
(N) ((V) (D N))</p>

<p>Bracketing (third phase):
((N) ((V) (D N)))</p>

<p>Please help. Thank you.</p>
","parsing, nlp, machine-learning","<p>Here's all I can say with the information provided:</p>

<p>A naive way for the bracketing would be to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1160160/generating-all-possible-trees-of-depth-n"">generate some trees</a> (generating <em>all</em> can quickly get very space consuming), having as many leaves as there are words (or components), then selecting a suitable one (at random or according to proper partitioning) and apply it as bracketing pattern. For more efficiency, look for a true random tree generation algorithm (I couldn't find one at the moment).</p>

<p>Additionally, I'd recommend reading about <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetic algos</a>/evolutionary programming, especially <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fitness_function"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">fitness fucnctions</a> (which are the ""check random results for correctness"" part). As far as I understood you, you want the program to detect ways of parsing and then keep them in memory as ""learned"". That quite matches a genetic algorithm with memorization of ""fittest"" patterns (and only mutation as changing factor).</p>

<p>An awesome, very elaborate (if working), but probably extremely difficult approach would be to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_programming"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">genetic programming</a>. But that's probably too different from what you want.</p>

<p>And last, the easiest way to check correctness of bracketing imo would be to keep a table with the grammar/syntax rules and compare with them. You also could improve this to a better fitness function by keeping them in a tree and measuring the distance from the actual pattern (<code>(V D) N</code>) to the correct pattern (<code>V (D N)</code>). (which is just some random idea, I've never actually done this..)</p>

This means it <strong>assumes the encoding has already been correctly guessed</strong> and the input byte sequence been converted to a <strong>Java string.</strong></p>

<p>When you use the library, you must make sure that is the case, i.e. if you are dealing with texts in unknown encodings (such as Japanese EUC-JP or SJIS), you must detect the encoding first and convert the string properly.</p>

semantic search engine and navigator,"<p>Hi I did a short course in AI and we designed a chatbot based on AIML and python. I have a new task to design some form of Semantic search engine. I want people to be able to navigate data or search for questions and I give them results. Initially it will be for specific topic e.g. transporation and geography. Some sample input from a user:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>How much will it cost for me to get from x to y? </p>

<p>Ans: It will cost you 26$</p></li>
<li><p>How far is x from z?</p>

<p>Ans: It is 25 Miles</p></li>
<li><p>A user can add facourite routes so they can simply type in, Add favourite roAnd the user will then be asked to enter the f routes. </p>

<p>Ans: Are you asking to add an entry to your favourite routes?</p>

<p>User:yes.</p>

<p>Ans: Please enter a favourite route.</p></li>
<li><p>Show my common routes.</p>

<p>Ans: Your common routes are x,y and z.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>So the data being searched may be specific to a user hence may have to use a database. Some data is external maybe envoke google maps to enquire on the distances. Some questions may simply require a response from a chatbot.</p>

<p><strong>How to replicate them? Do I need the original corpus? or, did the authors mean they could be recomputed from the material in the paper itself?</strong></p>
","nlp, machine-learning, stanford-nlp, opennlp, confusion-matrix","<p>Looking at the paper, you just need to calculate them using a corpus, either the same one or one relevant to your application.</p>

<p>In replicating the matrices, note that they implicitly define two different <code>chars</code> matrices: a vector and an n-by-n matrix. For each character <code>x</code>, the vector <code>chars</code> contains a count of the number of times the character <code>x</code> occurred in the corpus. For each character sequence <code>xy</code>, the matrix <code>chars</code> contains a count of the number of times that sequence occurred in the corpus.</p>

<p><code>chars[x]</code> represents a look-up of <code>x</code> in the vector; <code>chars[x,y]</code> represents a look-up of the sequence <code>xy</code> in the matrix. Note that <code>chars[x]</code> = the sum over <code>chars[x,y]</code> for each value of <code>y</code>.</p>

If you can't use their exact corpus, I don't think it would be unreasonable to use another text from the same genre (i.e. another newswire corpus) and scale your counts such that they fit the original data. That is, the frequency of a given character shouldn't vary too much from one text to another if they're similar enough, so if you've got a corpus of 22 million words of newswire, you could count characters in that text and then double them to approximate their original counts.</p>

Dataset for common words to construct basic sentences,"<p>So I am making a ""fridge magnet"" interactive and I was trying to figure out a valid dataset for words to have for the user to drag around.</p>

<p>I am using this data set .. but it is not that great</p>

<p><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Most_common_words_in_English</a></p>

<p>and ideas where to find a more valid set of words</p>
","dataset, nlp, linguistics","<p>One way you could do this yourself is to download a corpus of text, and then run a script that counts up the number of each word that appears.  Then pick some value <em>N</em> and divide every count by <em>N</em> (rounding down).  For each word, make a magnet for each divided count.  You should pick <em>N</em> based on how many magnets you want out at the end.</p>

<p>This has the advantage of having the distribution of magnets match the distribution of words.  For example, if ""the"" appears 1000 times, ""man"" 320 times, ""walks"" 150 times, and ""skips"" 2 times, and you pick <em>N</em> to be 100, then you will end up making 10 ""the"" magnets, 3 ""man"", 1 ""walks"", and 0 ""skips"".</p>

<p>You might also want to take the logarithm of the counts to try and reduce the skew.  Since word distributions are <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipfian_distribution"" rel=""nofollow"">Zipfian</a>, you might end up with thousands of ""the"" magnets for each ""walks"").</p>

<p>Finally, the nice thing about this approach is that you could run it on a particular domain to make a word magnet set for that domain.  For example, if you want to make word magnets that sound like news stories, then run it on a corpus of news stories.  If you want to make word magnets that sound like fairy tales, then run it on a corpus of fairy tales.</p>

<p>If you really want to get fancy you could use something like <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tf%2aidf"" rel=""nofollow"">TF-IDF</a> to pick out the words that are most representative of that domain and then mix them with common function words.</p>

Regex replace for large number of search replace pairs,"<p>I want to be able to do large scale search and replace across documents for purposes of text normalisation.</p>

<p>For example: </p>

<li>Find all ampersands (&amp;) and replace with the word <strong>and</strong>    </li>

  r('USA','United States Of America'),
  (r'U\.S\.A','United States Of America'),
  (r'US of A', 'United States of America')]

for replacement in replacements:

NLP library for determining if a sentence is equivalent to another sentence?,"<p>I would like to find an NLP library in Python, PHP or even JavaScript for determining whether a sentence in a string is equivalent to a differently structured sentence?</p>

<p>For example, the library would need to be able to determine whether these two sentences are equivalent:</p>

<p>""Would you like the order for here or to go?""
""Do you want the order for here or to go?""</p>

<p>Is there such a thing?  Or would it actually be easier for me to build something like this myself for the specific application I need it for?</p>
","php, javascript, python, nlp","<p>What you are describing is the task of ""paraphrase"" (or bidirectional ""textual entailment"").  This is an extremely hard problem and an open research area.  I doubt that there is a system available that would do well enough on this task for real-world, general use.</p>

<p>If you have a very narrow set of transformations in mind (such as the ""would you like"" &lt;-> ""do you want"" alternation), you could try and construct a set of transformation rules that convert one sentence to the other.  These rules could act directly on the sentence or on a parse tree produced from a statistical parser.</p>

What methods are used for recognizing language a text is written in?,"<p>If I have a given text (both long or short), with which methods do you usually detect which language it is written in?</p>

<p>It is clear that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need a training corpus to train the models you use (e.g. neural networks, if used)</li>
</ul>

<p>Easiest thing coming to my mind is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check characters used in the text (e.g. hiragana are only used in Japanese, Umlauts probably only in European languages, Ã§ in French, Turkish, â¦)</li>
<li>Increase the check to two or three letter pairs to find specific combinations of a language</li>
<li>Lookup a dictionary to check which words occur in which language (probably only without stemming, as stemming depends on the language)</li>
</ul>

<p>But I guess there are better ways to go. I am not searching for existing projects (those questions have already been answered), but for methods like Hidden-Markov-Models, Neural Networks, â¦ whatever may be used for this task.</p>
",nlp,"<p>In product I'm working on we use dictionary-based approach.
First relative probabilities for all words in training corpus are calculated and this is stored as a model.</p>

<p>Then input text is processed word by word to see if particular model gives best match (much better then the other models).</p>

<p>In some cases all models provide quite bad match.</p>

<p>Few interesting points:</p>

<ol>
<li>As we are working with social media both normalized and non-normalized matches are attempted (in this context normalization is removal of diacritics from symbols). Non-normalized matches have a higher weight</li>
<li>This method works rather bad on very short phrases (1-2 words) in particular when these words are there in few languages, which is the case of few European languages</li>
</ol>

<p>Also for a better detection we are considering added per-character model as you have described (certain languages have certain unique characters)</p>

<p>Btw, we use ICU library to split words. Works rather good for European and Eastern languages (currently we support Chinese)</p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong></p>

<p>Although not high on my list of priorities because my book doesnt contain a lot of direct quotations nor direct speeches but a rule that handles sentences that are inside those would also be in order so that sentences from the same qoute dont end up on new lines  </p>
","java, nlp","<p><a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Stanford's CoreNLP</a> toolkit has a class that does sentence segmentation.  See more <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>.</p>

<p>If you say <code>new DocumentPreprocessor(new StringReader(s)).iterator()</code> where <code>s</code> is a string containing the text, it will give you back an iterator of sentences.</p>

<p>Note that this will tokenize the sentence as well.  If you want the sentence to look the way it started, you can either just use this output as a guide for splitting, or run the <code>PTBTokenizer -untok</code> command (see same link as above) to make each tokenized sentence look normal again.</p>

<p>This will almost certainly work better than your list of rules since your rules don't account for many of the important cases.</p>

Poor Bailey. No one has wanted his fat gray book for thirty years. Sometimes I wonder what he makes of his role as guardian of the bookshop keys. I don't suppose it's the destiny he had in mind for the masterwork that he spent two decades writing. A letter. For me. That was something of an event. The crisp-cornered envelope, puffed up with its thickly folded contents, was addressed in a hand that must have given the postman a certain amount of trouble. Although the style of the writing was old-fashioned, with its heavily embellished capitals and curly flourishes, my first impression was that it had been written by a child. The letters seemed untrained. Their uneven strokes either faded into nothing or were heavily etched into the paper. There was no sense of flow in the letters that spelled out my name."";

Reaching an appropriate balance between performance and scalability in a large database,"<p>I'm trying to determine which of the many database models would best support probabilistic record comparison. Specifically, I have approximately 20 million documents defined by a variety of attributes (name, type, author, owner, etc.). Text attributes dominate the data set, yet there are still plenty of images. Read operations are the most crucial vis-a-vis performance, but I expect roughly 20,000 new documents to insert each week. Luckily, insert speed does not matter at all, and I am comfortable queuing the incoming documents for controlled processing.</p>

<p>Database queries will most typically take the following forms:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>Find documents containing at least five sentences that reference someone who'a a member of the military</code></li>
<li><code>Predict whether User A will comment on a specific document written by User B, given User A's entire comment history</code></li>
<li><code>Predict an author for Document X by comparing vocabulary, word ordering, sentence structure, and concept flow</code></li>
</ul>

<p>My first thought was to use a simple <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database"" rel=""nofollow"">document store</a> like, like <a href=""http://www.mongodb.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">MongoDB</a>, since each document does not necessarily contain the same data. However, complex queries effectively degrade this to a file system wrapper, since I cannot construct a query yielding the results I desire. As such, this approach corners me into walking the entire database and processing each file separately. Although document stores scale well horizontally, the benefits are not realized here.</p>

<p>This led me to realize that my granularity <em>isn't</em> at the document level, but rather the <em>entity-relationship</em> level. As such, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_database"" rel=""nofollow"">graph databases</a> seemed like logical choice, since they facilitate relating each word in a sentence to the next word, next paragraph, current paragraph, part of speech, etc. Graph databases limit data replication, increase the speed of statistical clustering, and scale horizontally, among other things. Unfortunately, ensuring a definitive answer to your query still necessitates traversing the entire graph. Even still, indexing will help with performance.</p>

<p>I've also evaluated the use of relational databases, which are very efficient when designed properly (i.e., by avoiding unnecessary normalization). A relational database excels at finding all documents authored by User A, but fails at structural comparisons (which involves expensive joins). Relational databases also enforce constraints (primary keys, foreign keys, uniqueness, etc.) efficiently--a task with which some NoSQL solutions struggle.</p>

<p><strong>After considering the above-listed requirements, are there any database models that combine the ""exactness"" of relational models (<em>viz.</em>, efficient exhaustion of the domain) with the flexibility of graph databases?</strong></p>

NER naive algorithm,"<p>I never really dealt with NLP but had an idea about NER which should NOT have worked and somehow DOES exceptionally well in one case. I do not understand why it works, why doesn't it work or weather it can be extended. </p>

<p>The idea was to extract names of the main characters in a story through:</p>

<ol>
<li>Building a dictionary for each word</li>
<li>Filling for each word a list with the words that appear right next to it in the text</li>
<li>Finding for each word a word with the max correlation of lists (meaning that the words are used similarly in the text)</li>
<li>Given that one name of a character in the story, the words that are used like it, should be as well (Bogus, that is what should not work but since I never dealt with NLP until this morning I started the day naive)  </li>
</ol>

<p>I ran the overly simple code (attached below) on <a href=""http://www.umich.edu/~umfandsf/other/ebooks/alice30.txt"" rel=""nofollow"">Alice in Wonderland</a>, which for ""Alice"" returns:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>21 ['Mouse', 'Latitude', 'William', 'Rabbit', 'Dodo', 'Gryphon', 'Crab', 'Queen', 'Duchess', 'Footman', 'Panther', 'Caterpillar', 'Hearts', 'King', 'Bill', 'Pigeon', 'Cat', 'Hatter', 'Hare', 'Turtle', 'Dormouse']</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Though it filters for upper case words (and receives ""Alice"" as the word to cluster around), originally there are ~500 upper case words, and it's still pretty spot on as far as <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland#Characters"" rel=""nofollow"">main characters</a> goes.</p>

<p>It does not work that well with other characters and in other stories, though gives interesting results. </p>

<p>Any idea if this idea is usable, extendable or why does it work at all in this story for ""Alice"" ?</p>

Clean text coming from PDFs,"<p>this is more of an algorithmic question rather than a specific language question, so I am happy to receive an answer in any language - even pseudocode, even just an idea.</p>

<p>Here is my problem: I need to work on large dataset of papers that come from articles in PDF and that were brutally copied/pasted into .txt. I only have the result of this abomination, which is around 16k papers, for 3.5 GB or text (the corpus I am using is the ACL Antology Network, <a href=""http://clair.si.umich.edu/clair/aan/DatasetContents.html"">http://clair.si.umich.edu/clair/aan/DatasetContents.html</a> ).</p>

I already spent a week on it, and then I decided to move on with a quick&amp;dirty fix. I don't care about cleaning it completely anymore, I don't care about false negatives and positives as long as the majority of this areas of text is removed.</p>

  <p>Table 4 summarizes the precision results for both English and Romanian coreference.
  The results indicate that the English coreference is more indicate than the Romanian coreference, but SNIZZLE improves coreference resolution in both languages.
  There were 64% cases when the English coreference was resolved by a heuristic with higher priority than the corresponding heuristic for the Romanian counterpart.
  This result explains why there is better precision enhancement for

Table 5 also illustrates the recall results.
  The advantage of the data-driven coreference resolution over other methods is based on its better recall performance.
  This is explained by the fact that this method captures a larger variety of coreference patterns.
  Even though other coreference resolution systems perform better for some specific forms of systems, their recall results are surpassed by the systems approach.
  Multilingual coreference in turn improves more the precision than the recall of the monolingual data-driven coreference systems.
  In addition, Table 5 shows that the English coref- erence results in better recall than Romanian coref- erence.
  However, the recall shows a decrease for both languages for SNIZZLE because imprecise coreference links are deleted.
  As is usually the case, deleting data lowers the recall.
  All results were obtained by using the automatic scorer program developed for the MUC evaluations.</p>

<p>Note how the table does not contain strange characters and goes right in the middle of the sentence: ""This result explains why there is better precision enhancement for -TABLE HERE- the English coreference."" I can't know where the table will be in regard to the running text. It may occur before a sentence, after it or within it like in this case. Also note that the table shit does not end with a full stop (most captions in papers don't...) so I can't rely on punctuation to spot it. I am happy with non-accurate boundaries of course, but I still need to do something with these tables. Some of them contain words rather than numbers, and I don't have enough information in those cases: no junky characters, nothing. It is obvious to only humans :S</p>

<p>Few ideas that you might find helpful (I used each and every one of them myself in that point or another)</p>

<ol>
<li><p>(Very brute force) : Using a tokenizer and a dictionary (real dictionary, not the data structure) - parse the words out and any word which is not a dictionary word - remove it. It might prove problematic if your text contains a lot of company/products names - but this too can be solved using the correct indexes (there are a few on the web - I'm using some propriety ones so I can't share them, sorry) </p></li>
<li><p>Given a set of clean documents (lets say a 2K), build an tf/idf index of them, and use this as a dictionary - every term from the other documents that doesn't appear in the index (or appears with a very low tf/idf) - remove it. This should give you a rather clean document.</p></li>
<li><p>Use Amazon's mechanical turk mechanism : set up a task where the person reading the document needs to mark the paragraph that doesn't make sense. Should be rather easy for the mechanical turk platform (16.5K is not that much) - this will probably cost you a couple of hundred $ , but you'll probably get a rather nice cleanup of the text (So if it's on corporate money, that can be your way out - they need to pay for their mistakes :) ).</p></li>
<li><p>Considering your documents are from the same domain (same topics, all in all), and the problems are quite the same (same table headers, roughly same formulas): Break all the documents to sentences, and try clustering the sentences using ML. If the table headers / formulas are relatively similar, they should cluster nicely away from the rest of the sentences, and then you can clean the documents sentence-by-sentence (Get a document, break it to sentences,  for each sentence, if it's part of the ""weird"" cluster, remove it)</p></li>

what&#39;s the maximum number of nominal values in a nominal attribute for SVM training in WEKA?,"<p>I have an NLP problem and I plan to use classifying in WEKA with SVMs.
I'm trying to classify words - the POS tagset has 24 tags, and the base phrase chunk (BPC) tagset has 15 tags.</p>

<p>But I have ""feature sets"", and I want each word to be classified for each of its features.</p>

<p>The first feature set is {POS}, so that'll be 24 nominal values for the nominal attribute POS.

What is Oracle experiment?,"<p>I have read a paper about machine learning and it contains an Oracle experiment to compare between his study and another study?
But it does not seem to be so clear what is Oracle experiment?</p>
","nlp, machine-learning","<p>An ""oracle"" is an imaginary entity that always gives the right answer.  An oracle experiment is used to compare your actual system to how your system would behave if some component of it always did the right thing.</p>

<p>For example, in the NLP domain, let's assume you built a parser that takes part-of-speech (POS) tagged sentences as input.  In the real world, you would have to run real sentences through an actual POS tagger.  This tagger would probably produce results with accuracy above 90%, but less than 100%.  Since the accuracy of your parser depends on the accuracy of the incoming tags, your parser's performance will be negatively affected by this loss.  </p>

<p>In order to see how well your parser would perform <em>if the POS tagger was perfect</em>, you could run an experiment with an oracle tagger.  In this experiment, you would replace the real POS tagger with a program that knows the actual POS tags for the sentences, thus always returning tag results with 100% accuracy.</p>

<p>So, if your parser gets 85% accuracy in an experiment with a real tagger, and 90% in an experiment with an oracle tagger, then you know that 5% of your performance loss is directly due to the mistakes of the tagger.</p>

<p>EDIT: To avoid rolling out my own hash table I decided to learn how to use glib. Along the way I found an excellent tutorial which walks through a similar problem. <a href=""http://bo.majewski.name/bluear/gnu/GLib/ch03s03.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://bo.majewski.name/bluear/gnu/GLib/ch03s03.html</a></p>

<p>I am awestruck by the number of different approaches, and in particular the simplicity and elegance of the Ruby implementation.</p>
","c, algorithm, nlp, counting","<p>Yes, a dictionary with word-occurence pairs would work fine, and the usual way to implement such a dictionary would be to use a hash table (or, sometimes, a binary search tree).</p>

<p>You could also use a <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie"" rel=""noreferrer"">trie</a> (or its compressed version, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree"" rel=""noreferrer"">""Patricia trie""</a>/Radix trie) whose complexity is asymptotically optimal for this problem, although I suspect that in practice it might be slower than a (good) hash table implementation.</p>

<p>[I really think whether hash tables or tries are better depends on the distribution of words in your input -- e.g. a hash table will need to store each word in its hash bucket (to guard against collisions), while if you have a lot of words with common prefixes, in a trie those common prefixes are shared and need to be stored only once each, but there is still the overhead of all the pointers... if you do happen to try both, I'm curious to know how they compare.]</p>

&#39;Following&#39; an object,"<p>I am trying to develop a real-time feed, and have run into a dilemma. I have the standard event, with a user as the subject -</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Person</strong> is now <strong>action</strong>. [ For example, ""<strong>John</strong> is now <strong>connected with Steve</strong>"". ]</li>
</ul>

<p>This event occurs when a person that I am following does something.</p>

<p>In addition, I also have an event that is dependent on a non-user object, a ""production"" -</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Production</strong> is now <strong>action</strong> [ For example, <strong>Titanic</strong> now <strong>includes Kate Winslet in its credits</strong>.</li>
</ul>

<p>In other words, users can follow other 1) users or 2) productions. However, the two events may butt into each other. Suppose the following example.</p>

<p>1) </p>

<ul>
<li>David is not following the user Steve.</li>
<li>David is following the production Titanic</li>
<li>Titanic has a new event, which involves the user Steve.</li>
<li>Since David is following Titanic and not Steve, David;s feed will say something like:<br>
   ""<strong>Titanic</strong> now includes <strong>Steve</strong> in its credits"".</li>
<li>Now David starts following Steve, the above grammar works but suppose this case:</li>
</ul>

<p>2) </p>

<ul>
<li>David is following Steve now, but not Titanic.</li>
<li>Steve joins the production Titanic. On David's feed would say something like:<br>
""<strong>Steve</strong> joined the production <strong>Titanic</strong>"".</li>
<li>Now David starts following the Titanic, the above grammar works, but is in conflict with 1) based upon the ordering of events.</li>
</ul>

<p>It seems this is why sites like Facebook/LinkedIn <strong>always</strong> have a single consistent object as the subject of the event (a user, in their cases). </p>

Convert Chinese Pinyin with accents to numerical form,"<p>I'm looking to convert Pinyin where the tone marks are written with accents (e.g.: NÃ­n hÇo) to Pinyin written in numerical/ASCII form (e.g.: Nin2 hao1).</p>

<p>Does anyone know of any libraries for this, preferably PHP? Or know Chinese/Pinyin well enough to comment?</p>

<p>I started writing one myself that was rather simple, but I don't speak Chinese and don't fully understand the rules of when words should be split up with a space.</p>

<p>I was able to write a translator that converts:</p>

<p><code>NÃ­n hÇo. WÇ shÃ¬ zhÅng guÃ³ rÃ©n</code> ==> <code>Nin2 hao3. Wo3 shi4 zhong1 guo2 ren2</code></p>

<p>But how do you handle words like the following - do they get split up with a space into multiple words, or do you interject the tone numbers within the word (if so, where?) :
<code>huÄ shÃ­jiÄn</code>, <code>wÃ¨ishÃ©nme</code>, <code>yuÃ¨lÃ¡iyuÃ¨</code>, <code>shÄngbÃ¬ng</code>, etc.</p>
","php, nlp, cjk","<p>The problem with parsing pinyin without the space separating each word is that there will be ambiguity. Take, for instance, the name of an ancient Chinese capital <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changan"">é¿å®</a>: ChÃ¡ng'Än (notice the disambiguating apostrophe). If we strip out the apostrophe however this can be interpreted in two ways: <code>ChÃ¡n gÄn</code> or <code>ChÃ¡ng Än</code>. A Chinese would tell you that the second is far more likely, depending on the context of course, but there's no way your computer can do that. </p>

<p>Assuming no ambiguity, and that all input are valid, the way I would do it would look something like this: </p>

<ol>
<li>Create accent folding function</li>
<li>Create an array of valid pinyin (You should take it from the Wikipedia page for pinyin)</li>
<li>Match each word to the list of valid pinyin</li>
<li>Check ahead to the next word when there is ambiguity about the possibility of the last character belonging to the next word, such as:</li>
</ol>

 <pre>
 shÄngbÃ¬ng
     ^ Does this 'g' belong to the next word?

<p>Anyway, the correct positioning of the numerical representation of the tones, and the correct numerals to represent each accent are covered fairly well in this section of the Wikipeda article on pinyin: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Numerals_in_place_of_tone_marks"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin#Numerals_in_place_of_tone_marks</a>.

Regexp for Tokenizing English Text,"<p>What would be the best regular expression for tokenizing an English text?</p>

<p>By an English token, I mean an atom consisting of maximum number of characters that can be meaningfully used for NLP purposes. An analogy is a ""token"" in any programming language (e.g. in C, '{', '[', 'hello', '&amp;', etc. can be tokens). There is one restriction: Though English punctuation characters can be ""meaningful"", let's ignore them for the sake of simplicity when they do not appear in the middle of \w+. So, ""Hello, world."" yields 'hello' and 'world'; similarly, ""You are good-looking."" may yield either [you, are, good-looking] or [you, are, good, looking].</p>

Mapping words to numbers with respect to definition,"<p>As part of a larger project, I need to read in text and represent each word as a number.

<p>Now, obviously I can just use a hashing algorithm to get these numbers. However, it would be more useful if words with similar meanings had numerical values close to each other, so that '<strong><em>good</em></strong>' becomes '<strong>6827</strong>' and '<strong><em>great</em></strong>' becomes '<strong>6835</strong>', etc. </p>

<p>As another option, instead of a simple integer representing each number, it would be even better to have a vector made up of multiple numbers, eg (<i>lexical_category</i>, <em>tense</em>, <em>classification</em>, <i>specific_word</i>) where <i>lexical_category</i> is noun/verb/adjective/etc, <em>tense</em> is future/past/present, <em>classification</em> defines a wide set of general topics and <i>specific_word</i> is much the same as described in the previous paragraph.</p>

<p>Yes, this code is very loop-happy. I am using brute-force because the recall is very important. So, I'm wondering how can I make it faster since I am not only running it for 200000 data for millions of data and the computers of the client are not high-end (1GB-2GB of Ram Pentium 4 or Dual-Core, the computer where I test this program is a Dual Core with 4GB of Ram). I came across TF/IDF but I do not know if it will be sufficient. And I wonder how can google make searches real time.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

<p>Edit:
This program is a data filterer. From 200,000 dummy data (actual data is about 12M), I must filter data that is irrelevant to the samples (500 dummy samples, I still do not know how much the actual amount of samples).</p>

<p>With the given dummy data and samples, the running time is about 1 hour but after tinkering here and there, I have successfully lessen it to 10-15 minutes. I have lessen it by grouping the fields and samples that begin with the same character (discounting special and non-meaningful words e.g. the, a, an) and matching the fields to the sample with the same first character. I know there is a problem there. What if the field was misspelled at the first character? But I think the number of those are negligible. The samples are spelled correctly since it is always maintained.</p>

","java, nlp, sentiment-analysis","<p>First, I'd highly recommend using python, as the NLP libraries are a bit more user friendly than java, and it'd be a lot less code to maintain for a one-man project.</p>

<p>I can't think of anything off the top of my head to do either classification, so my recommendation would be to train two classifiers, one for subject, and one for sentiment. You'll have to label data and define features, but I think that wouldn't be too hard, especially with sentiment where you build up a dictionary of 'emotion' words. Labeling data is a pain in the ass, but that and good features are how you get good classification.</p>

<p><strong>Subject Classifier:</strong></p>

<p>Use NLTK with a Naive Bayes classifier, and define features as the word (lowercased), and word bigrams and trigrams.</p>

<p><strong>Sentiment Classifier:</strong></p>

<p>Same features as subject classifier, but also have a feature that says word w is in emotion dictionary with connection c. So, word 'bad' means 'bad sentiment'.</p>

<p>Once you've amassed sufficient training/testing data, you train your classifiers and optimize features, if necessary, and then you can run the classifiers against whatever other data you want.</p>

<p>However, I want to use these basic sound units for my own custom purpose, so I don't want any high-level processing that tries to extract genuine Japanese words. I just want to get the raw Kana.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of such a technology?</p>

<p>I just learned today that the Japanese ' alphabet ' is basically a 10x5 grid of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana"" rel=""nofollow"">Kana</a>.  10 columns ( empty + 9 consonants ) and 5 rows ( vowels )</p>

<p>and each element is called a 'Kana', and the language consists of sequences of these Kana; these are the basic building blocks.</p>

<p>This must surely have a large impact on speech recognition algorithms.</p>

<p>For Western languages, all commercial speech recognition engines I am aware of derive from <a href=""http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">CMUSphinx</a> which operates on a tri-gram model:  it represents each movement between three phonemes with a unique MFCC vector and figures out the most likely tri-gram sequence(s) for an utterance (from which it can deduce trivially the phonemes, and then run through its dictionary of WORD-triplets, to figure out the most likely sentence).</p>

<p>But for a language such as Japanese, I would guess that this may no longer be the most efficient algorithm.</p>

<p>Instead, it may make sense to try and catch each individual Kana,  or Kana-pair.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> This is not a security question, I don't care if someone else will be able to recover the information or even detect that it is there or not.</em></p>

<p>Criteria for better phrases, from most important to the least: </p>

<ul>
<li>Short</li>
<li>Unique</li>
<li>Natural-looking</li>

<p>The current approach, suggested <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4683551/generating-a-pseudo-natural-phrase-from-a-big-integer-in-a-reversible-way/4684842#4684842"">here</a>:</p>

<p>Take three lists of 1024 nouns, verbs and adjectives each (picking most popular ones). Generate a phrase by the following pattern, reading 20 bits for each word:</p>

<pre>
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb.
</pre>

<p>Now, this seems to be a good approach, but the phrase is a bit too long and a bit too dull.</p>

<p>I have found a corpus of words <a href=""http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (Part of Speech Database).</p>

<p>After some ad-hoc filtering, I calculated that this corpus contains, approximately</p>

<ul>
<li>50690 usable adjectives</li>
<li>123585 nouns</li>
<li>15301 verbs</li>
<li>13010 adverbs (not included in pattern, but mentioned in answers)</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows me to use up to</p>

<ul>
<li>16 bits per adjective (actually 16.9, but I can't figure how to use fractional bits)</li>
<li>15 bits per noun</li>
<li>13 bits per verb</li>
<li>13 bits per adverb</li>
</ul>

<p>For noun-verb-adjective-verb pattern this gives 57 bits per ""sentence"" in phrase. This means that, if I'll use all words I can get from this corpus, I can generate three sentences instead of four (160 / 57 â 2.8).</p>

<pre>
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb.
</pre>

<p>Still a bit too long and dull.</p>

<p>Any hints how can I improve it?</p>

<p>What I see that I can try:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try to compress my data somehow before encoding. But since the data is completely random, only some phrases would be shorter (and, I guess, not by much).</p></li>
<li><p>Improve phrase pattern, so it would look better.</p></li>
<li><p>Use several patterns, using the first word in phrase to somehow indicate for future decoding which pattern was used. (For example, use the last letter or even the length of the word.) Pick pattern according to the first bytes of the data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...I'm not that good with English to come up with better phrase patterns. Any suggestions?</p>

<ul>
<li>Use more linguistics in the pattern. Different tenses etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>...I guess, I would need much better word corpus than I have now for that. Any hints where can I get a suitable one?</p>

Natural language grammar and user-entered names,"<p>Some languages, particularly Slavic languages, change the endings of people's names according to the grammatical context. (For those of you who know grammar or studied languages that do this to words, such as German or Russian, and to help with search keywords, I'm talking about noun declension.)</p>

<p>This is probably easiest with a set of examples (in Polish, to save the whole different-alphabet problem):</p>

<ol>
<li>Dorothy saw the cat â <em>Dorota zobaczyÅa kota</em></li>
<li>The cat saw Dorothy â <em>Kot zobaczyÅ DorotÄ</em></li>

<li>I went for a walk with Dorothy â <em>PoszÅam na spacer z DorotÄ</em></li>
<li>âHello, Dorothy!â â <em>âWitam, Doroto!â</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, if, in these examples, the name here were to be user-entered, that introduces a world of grammar nightmares. Importantly, if I went for Katie (<em>Kasia</em>), the <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Polish/Feminine_noun_declension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">examples are not directly comparable</a> â 3 and 4 are both <em>Kasi</em>, rather than <em>*Kasy</em> and <em>*Kasie</em> â and male names will be <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Polish/Masculine_noun_declension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wholly different again</a>.</p>

Better approach to filtering Wikipedia edits,"<p>When you are watching for news of particular <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kristen_Stewart"" rel=""nofollow"">Wikipedia article</a> via its <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Kristen_Stewart&amp;feed=atom&amp;action=history"" rel=""nofollow"">RSS channel</a>,
its annoying without filtering the information, because most of the edits is spam,
vandalism, minor edits etc.</p>

<p>My approach is to create filters. I decided to remove all edits that don't contain a nickname of the contributor but are identified only by the IP address of the contributor, because most of such edits is spam (though there are some good contributions). This was easy to do with regular expressions.
I also removed edits that contained vulgarisms and other typical spam keywords.</p>

<p>Do you know some better approach utilizing algorithms or heuristics with regular expressions, AI, text-processing techniques etc.? The approach should be able to detect bad posts (minor edits or vandalisms) and should be able to incrementally learn what is good/bad contribution and update its database.</p>

Personally, I prefer the even easier to implement Winnow2 algorithm (details can be found in this <a href=""http://www.siefkes.net/ie/winnow-spam.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">paper</a>).</p>

<p>First you need to extract features from the text you want to classify.

Alternatively you could directly use the <a href=""http://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/API%3aMain_page"" rel=""nofollow"">Mediawiki API</a> or see if one of the bot frameworks linked at the bottom of <a href=""http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Bot"" rel=""nofollow"">this page</a> is of help to you.</p>

<p>Ideally you would end up with a list of words that were added, words that were removed, various statistics you can compute from that, and the metadata of the edit. I imagine the list of features would look something like this:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>editComment: wordA</code> (wordA appears in edit comment)</li>
<li><code>-wordB</code> (wordB removed from article)</li>
<li><code>+wordC</code> (wordC added to article)</li>

<li><code>editIsMinor: Yes</code></li>
<li><code>editByAnIP: No</code></li>
<li><code>editorUsername: Foo</code></li>

Difference between word stemming and depluralization,"<p>In understanding string matching: What is the exact difference between <em>word stemming</em> and <em>depluralization?</em></p>

<p>Or do they mean the same thing?</p>
","nlp, stemming, pluralize","<p>First, <strong>stemming</strong> refers to the process of reducing a word to its stem. However, that may mean a number of different things. Most linguists differentiate between at least two ways of doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Removing <em>grammatical</em>, but not <em>derivational</em> morphemes. Grammatical morphemes are components of the word that are related to its grammatical role in a particular sentence, e.g. <em>number</em>, <em>case</em>, <em>gender</em>, <em>tense</em>, <em>aspect</em> etc.</p></li>
<li><p>Removing <em>both</em> grammatical and derivational morphemes. Derivational morphemes are components of the word that are related to its derivation from another word, e.g. the ""-er"" in ""worker"" is related to how it is derived (or can be considered as derived) from ""work"".</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Therefore, <strong>depluralization</strong>, which is a rather unusual term, but obviously refers to removing a plural morpheme (such as the ""-s"" at the end of ""computers""), is <strong>part of a kind of stemming</strong>, specifically a part of the removal of grammatical (but not derivational) morphemes.</p>

<p>In <strong>English</strong>, the morphology of <strong>nouns</strong> is largely limited to plural (""computers"") and genitive (second case, ""computer's""), hence as far as English is concerned, depluralization may be seen as (almost) synonymous with (grammatical) stemming, at least to the extent that stemming is applied to <em>nouns</em>, and, to some degree, <em>adjectives</em>, (which it is e.g. in the context of information retrieval). However, wherever <em>verbs</em> are considered, <em>past tense</em>, <em>passive voice</em> and other inflectional forms are subject to stemming (but not to depluralization).</p>

<p>Furthermore, in languages other than English, even nouns may have a very rich morphology, including morphemes for such things as case, politeness level, or special kinds of plural (such as dual). And then, depluralization (if you want to use that term at all) would refer to only a very small part of the overall stemming process.</p>

<p>Another related term is <strong>lemmatization</strong>, which is often used synonymously with <strong>stemming</strong>. One distinction between the two that I found many people (including myself) to make is this:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Stemming</strong> is used to refer to a <strong>rule-based or machine-learning based</strong> technique that removes parts of a word (mostly endings) that look like grammatical morphemes</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Lemmatization</strong> is used to refer to a process that does the same, but using an actual <strong>dictionary</strong> of the language to deal with highly irregular forms (such as the plural ""women"")</p></li>
</ul>

<p>(But, again, not everyone will agree with this distinction.)</p>

Sentence Classification (Categorization),"<p>I have been reading about text classification and found several Java tools which are available for classification, but I am still wondering: Is text classification the same as sentence classification!</p>

<p>Is there any tool which focuses on sentence classification?</p>
","java, nlp, weka, gate","<p>Theres no formal difference between 'Text classification' and 'Sentence classification'. After all, a sentence is a type of text. But generally, when people talk about text classification, IMHO they mean larger units of text such as an essay, review or speech. Classifying a politician's speech into democrat or republican is a lot easier than classifying a tweet. When you have a lot of text per instance, you don't need to squeeze each training instance for all the information it can give you and get pretty good performance out a bag-of-words naive-bayes model.  </p>

<p>Basically you might not get the required performance numbers if you throw off-the-shelf weka classifiers at a corpora of sentences. You might have to augment the data in the sentence with POS tags, parse trees, word ordering, ngrams, etc. Also get any related metadata such as creation time, creation location, attributes of sentence author, etc. Obviously all of this depends on what exactly are you trying to classify.. the features that will work out for you need to be intuitively meaningful to the problem at hand.</p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated.</p>
","solr, nlp, opennlp, part-of-speech","<p>Make a <strong>dictionary</strong> of the special nouns and perform dictionary-based extraction as a post-processing step. The dictionary-based extraction should take the distinction between lowercase and uppercase into account, in particular for those entries that are acronyms.</p>

<p>In terms of <strong>implementation of the dictionary lookup:</strong></p>

<ul>
<li><p>As long as the entities in question are single tokens (or consist only of a predefined, small maximum number M of tokens each), implementing the dictionary as <code>HashSet&lt;String&gt;</code>, tokenising the text and making look-ups in the hash for each token (and groups of up to M tokens) should work very well</p></li>
<li><p>If you are dealing with very long entities, or if tokenization is a problem, the use of a search trie or finite state machine implementation of the dictionary is sensible.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Finally, as always with NLP, you will need to <strong>look at a significant sample of the results</strong> to identify any further problems.

<p>Finally, if it's not an exact match, it should ask the user to disambiguate between the best matches</p>

<p>This is how I'm thinking of doing it:</p>

<ol>
<li>Stem both the context words and incoming queries </li>
<li>Delete/isolate command strings from the query </li>
<li>Check for and correct any anagrams (however: this only covers one category of spelling mistakes) </li>
<li>Look for an exact word match </li>
<li>Look for ""close matches""</li>
</ol>

<p>This doesn't feel like a neat solution, especially steps 3 and 5.</p>

<p>What's a better/easier way to do this? Any libraries to do it in C#, bonus.</p>

<p>Can Lucene do this perhaps? Any guidance appreciated.</p>

<p>Basically, I have a limited number of prefixes, which can be either one or two letters; a word can have more than one prefix. I also have a limited number of suffixes of one or two letters. Whatever's in between them should be the ""root"" of the word. Many words will have more the one possible parsing, so I want to input a word and get back a list of possible parses in the form of a tuple (prefix,root,suffix).</p>

Word partitions with maximum weight,"<p>I'm working on a game where I need to find the biggest weight for a specific sentence.</p>

<p>Suppose I have the sentence ""the quick brown fox"" and assume both single and double words with their defined weight: ""the"" -> 10, ""quick"" -> 5, ""brown"" -> 3, ""fox"" -> 8, ""the quick"" -> 5, ""quick brown"" -> 10, ""brown fox"" -> 1</p>

<p>I'd like to know which combination of single and double words provides the biggest weight, in this case it would be ""the"", ""quick brown"", ""fox"" (weight = 28)</p>

<p>I've been told this problem can be solved through linear programming, but I fail to see how to implement such method. Specifically, I don't know how to express the constraints of the problem, in this case the fact that some double words can't be combined with a single word which contains (ie. ""the quick"" can't be combined with either ""the"" or ""quick"")</p>

<p>May someone provide some guidance as to how approach this problem? I'm not an expert in the area and have some basic understanding of how Simplex works (back from school), but I lack the knowledge about how to model this kind of problem.</p>

<p>Also, any other approach (not involving linear programming nor brute force) would be welcomed too.</p>

Searching through an entire series of synsets (from NLTK) in Python NLP,"<p><em>Original question:</em></p>

<p><em>The polysemy of a word is the number of senses it has. Using WordNet, we can
determine that the noun dog has seven senses with len(wn.synsets('dog', 'n')).
Compute the average polysemy of nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs according
to WordNet.</em></p>

<p>From what I gathered from the question, I was to use a built in polysemy method in NLTK with WordNet to find out the number of senses something has.</p>

<p>More importantly, I am trying to use all of the available synsets available and loop them through,
and placing all of the values returned into a set.
After this, I would have intended to add the total number of all the synsets in the set(filled with integers) that was newly created to receive a sum.
After I obtain this sum, I would have divided the total number of entries to receive the average.</p>

<p>My biggest question is... how would I go about looping through <strong>all</strong> of the synsets available as well as the nouns, verbs, adjectives, and adverbs?</p>

<ul>
<li>After researching through various websites, I've found that for ""wn.all_synsets('n')"" will return all of the possible noun synsets.</li>
</ul>

<p>However the type it returns is a ""generator"", how would I go about using loops to iterate through a ""generator"" type?</p>

<p>.>>>allsynsets = wn.all_synsets('n')</p>

<p>.>>> allsynsets</p>

<p>&lt;.generator object all_synsets at 0x04359F30></p>

<p>.>>> type(allsynsets)</p>

<p>&lt;.type 'generator'></p>

<p>I hope I've provided enough information to allow anyone to find an answer to this problem.
I do not have source code, aside from imports and tests to understand the generator type for this problem.</p>

<p>Thank you for your time.</p>

Can OpenNLP use HTML tags as part of the training?,"<p>I'm creating a training set for the TokenNameFinder using html documents converted into plain text, but my precision is low and I want to use the HTML tags as part of the training. Like words in bold, and sentences in differents margin sizes.

Is there another way to make use of those tags to improve precision?</p>

chunks using python,"<p>I'm trying to extract all the proper nouns from a tagged paragraph.

<p>How can I extract all the tagged proper nouns from a paragraph?</p>
","python, nlp","<p>Thanks for the data sample.</p>

<p>You need to:</p>

<ul>
<li>read each paragraph/line</li>
<li>split the line by whitespace to extract each tagged word, e.g. <code>Summerdale/np</code></li>
<li>split the word by <code>/</code> to see if it is tagged <code>np</code></li>
<li>if so, add the other half of the split (the actual word) to your noun list</li>
</ul>

<p>So something like the following (based on <em>Bogdan</em>'s answer, thanks!)</p>

<pre><code>def noun(word):
    nouns = []
    for word in sentence.split():
      word, tag = word.split('/')
      if (tag.lower() == 'np'):
        nouns.append(word);
    return nouns

if __name__ == '__main__':
    nouns = []
    with open('tesu.txt', 'r') as file_p:
         for sentence in file_p.read().split('\n\n'): 
              result = noun(sentence)
              if result:
                   nouns.extend(result)
    print nouns
</code></pre>

<p>which for your example data, produces:</p>

<pre><code>['Summerdale', 'Bellows', 'Parsons', 'Alan', 'Clements']
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Update</strong>: In fact, you can shorten the whole thing down to this:</p>

<pre><code>nouns = []
with open('tesu.txt', 'r') as file_p:
  for word in file_p.read().split(): 
    word, tag = word.split('/')
    if (tag.lower() == 'np'):
      nouns.append(word)
print nouns
</code></pre>

<p>if you don't care which paragraph the nouns come from.</p>

<p>You could also get rid of the <code>.lower()</code> if the tags are always lowercase as they are in your example.</p>

","python, nlp, nltk","<p>You don't need to input the files yourself or to provide <code>words</code> and <code>sents</code> methods. 
Read in your corpus with <code>PlaintextCorpusReader</code>, and it will provide those for you.
The corpus reader constructor accepts arguments for the path and filename pattern of the files, and for the input encoding (be sure to specify it). </p>

<p>The constructor also has optional arguments for the sentence and word tokenization functions, so you can pass it your own method to break up the text into sentences. If word and sentence detection is really simple, i.e., if the | character has other uses, you can configure a tokenization function from the nltk's RegexpTokenizer family, or you can write your own from scratch. (Before you write your own, study the docs and code or write a stub to find out what kind of input it's called with.)</p>

<p>If recognizing sentence boundaries is non-trivial, you can later figure out how to train the nltk's PunktSentenceTokenizer, which uses an unsupervized statistical algorithm to learn which uses of the sentence terminator actually end a sentence.</p>

<p>If the configuration of your corpus reader is fairly complex, you may find it useful to create a class that specializes <code>PlaintextCorpusReader</code>. But much of the time that's not necessary. Take a look at the NLTK code to see how the gutenberg corpus is implemented: It's just a <code>PlainTextCorpusReader</code> instance with appropriate arguments for the constructor.</p>

","python, nlp, machine-learning, text-mining, semantic-analysis","<p>There are many things embedded in your question. I will try to provide you with a library or else will suggest you Algorithms that can solve your tasks (which you can Google and you will get many python implementations)</p>

<p><strong>Point 1</strong>. To extract main content out of html (http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch03.html) &amp; for other NLP related stuff you can check out NLTK. Its written in Python. You can also check out for a library called BeautifulSoup, its awesome (http://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/)</p>

<p><strong>Point 2</strong>. When you say:</p>

<p>Once I have the two extracted contents, I want to return a score between 0 and 1 denoting how similar they are....</p>

<p>For this I suggest you can cluster your document set using any unsupervised learning clustering technique. Since your problem falls under the distance-metric based clustering so it should be really easy for you to cluster similar documents and then assign a score to them based on their similarity with the cluster centroid. Try either K-Means or Adaptive Resonance Theory. In the latter you dont need to define the number of clusters in advance. OR as larsman points out in his comments you can simply use TF-IDF (http://www.miislita.com/term-vector/term-vector-3.html)</p>

<p><strong>Point 3</strong>.When you say:</p>

<p>For Automatic Summarization use Non Negative Matrix Factorization</p>

How to determine the proper weights for metric scores,"<p>I'm doing some personal research into text analysis, and have come up with close to 70 metrics (pronoun usage frequency, reading levels, vowel frequency, use of bullet points, etc) to ""score"" a piece of text. </p>

<p>Ideally, separate pieces of text from the same author would have similar scores. The ultimate goal is to index a great deal of authors, and use scores to guess at who wrote a separate, anonymous piece of text. </p>

<p>I'd like the scores to normalize from 0 to 100 and represent a percentage of how ""similar"" two pieces of text are in writing style. Questions like <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7041867/how-to-decide-on-weights"">How to decide on weights?</a> and <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/994819/how-to-calculate-scores"">How to calculate scores?</a> describe the math behind scoring metrics and how to normalize, but assume every metric is weighted the same.</p>

<p><strong>My question is this: how do I determine the proper weight to use when scoring each metric, to ensure that the cumulative score per-user most accurately describes the writing from that specific user?</strong></p>

<p>Also, weights can be assigned per-user. If syllables per word most aptly describes who wrote a piece for Alice, while the frequency of two-letter words is the best for Bob, I'd like Alice's heaviest weight to be on syllables per word, and Bob's to be on frequency of two-letter words.</p>
","algorithm, statistics, nlp, metrics, text-analysis","<p>If you want to do it with weighted scores, have a look at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis</a> - you could plot the values of the first (largest) couple of principal components for different authors and see if you find a clustering. You can also take a plot of the smallest few principal components and see if anything stands out - if it does, it is probably from a glitch or a mistake - it tends to pick out exceptions from general rules.</p>

<p>Another option is <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis"" rel=""nofollow"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_discriminant_analysis</a></p>

Building a lemmatizer: speed optimization,"<p>I am building a lemmatizer in python. As I need it to run in realtime/process fairly large amount of data the processing speed
is of the essence. 
Data: I have all possible suffixes that are linked to all wordtypes that they can be combined with. Additionally I have lemmaforms that are linked to both their wordtype(s) and lemma(s). The program takes a word as input and outputs its lemma.
word = lemmafrom + suffix</p>

<p>For example (Note: although the example is given in English I am not building a lemmatizer for English):</p>

<p>word:  forbidding</p>

<p>lemmaform: forbidd</p>

<p>suffix: ing</p>

<p>lemma: forbid</p>

<p>My solution:</p>

<p>I have converted the data to (nested) dicts:</p>

<pre><code>suffixdict : {suffix1:[type1,type2, ... , type(n)], suffix2:[type1,type2, ... ,
type(n)]}    
lemmaformdict : {lemmaform:{type1:lemma}}
</code></pre>

<p>1) Find all possible suffixes and word types that they are linked to.
If the longest possible suffix is 3 characters long, the program tries to match 'ing', 'ng', 'n' to the keys in 
suffixdict. If the key exists it returns a value (a set of wordtypes).</p>

<p>2) For each matching suffix search the lemmaform from the dict.
If lemmaform exists it returns the wordtypes.</p>

<p>3) Finally, the program tries to intersect the wordtypes produced in steps 1) ans 2) and if the intersection is
sucessful it returns the lemma of the word.</p>

<p>My question: could there be a better solution to my problem from the prespective of speed? (Disregarding the option to keep frequent words and lemmas in the dictionary) 
Help much appriciated.</p>

Spell checker solution in java,"<p>I need to implement a spell checker in java , let me give you an example for a string lets say ""sch aproblm iseasili solved"" my output is ""such a problem is easily solved"".The maximum length of the string to correct is 64.As you can see my string can have spaces inserted in the wrong places or not at all and even misspelled words.I need a little help in finding a efficient algorithm of coming up with the corrected string. I am currently trying to delete all spaces in my string and inserting spaces in every possible position , so lets say for the word (it apply to a sentence as well) ""hot"" i generate the next possible strings to afterwords be corrected word by word using levenshtein distance : h o t ; h ot; ho t; hot. As you can see i have generated 2^(string.length() -1) possible strings. So for a string with a length of 64 it will generate 2^63 possible strings, which is damn high, and afterwords i need to process them one by one and select the best one by a different set of parameters such as : - total editing distance (must take the smallest one)
-if i have more strings with same editing distance i have to choose the one with the fewer number of words
-if i have more strings with the same number of words i need to choose the one with the total maximum frequency the words have( i have a dictionary of the most frequent 8000 words along with their frequency )
-and finally if there are more strings with the same total frequency i have to take the smallest lexicographic one.</p>

<p>So basically i generate all possible strings (inserting spaces in all possible positions into the original string) and then one by one i calculate their total editing distance, nr of words ,etc. and then choose the best one, and output the corrected string. I want to know if there is a easier(in terms of efficiency) way of doing this , like not having to generate all possible combinations of strings etc.</p>

<p>EDIT:So i thought that i should take another approach on this one.Here is what i have in mind: I take the first letter from my string , and extract from the dictionary all the words that begin with that letter.After that i process all of them and extract from my string all possible first words. I will remain at my previous example , for the word ""hot"" by generating all possible combinations i got 4 results , but with my new algorithm i obtain only 2 ""hot"" , and ""ho"" , so it's already an improvement.Though i need a little bit of help in creating a recursive or PD algorithm for doing this . I need a way to store all possible strings for the first word , then for all of those all possible strings for the second word and so on and finally to concatenate all possibilities and add them into an array or something. There will still be a lot of combinations for large strings but not as many as having to do ALL of them. Can someone help me with a pseudocode or something , as this is not my strong suit.</p>

Interesting NLP/machine-learning style project -- analyzing privacy policies,"<p>I wanted some input on an interesting problem I've been assigned.  The task is to analyze hundreds, and eventually thousands, of privacy policies and identify core characteristics of them.  For example, do they take the user's location?, do they share/sell with third parties?, etc. </p>

<p>I've talked to a few people, read a lot about privacy policies, and thought about this myself.  Here is my current plan of attack:</p>

<p>First, read a lot of privacy and find the major ""cues"" or indicators that a certain characteristic is met.  For example, if hundreds of privacy policies have the same line: ""We will take your location."", that line could be a cue with 100% confidence that that privacy policy includes taking of the user's location.  Other cues would give much smaller degrees of confidence about a certain characteristic.. For example, the presence of the word ""location"" might increase the likelihood that the user's location is store by 25%.</p>

<p>The idea would be to keep developing these cues, and their appropriate confidence intervals to the point where I could categorize all privacy policies with a high degree of confidence.  An analogy here could be made to email-spam catching systems that use Bayesian filters to identify which mail is likely commercial and unsolicited.</p>

<p>I wanted to ask whether you guys think this is a good approach to this problem.  How exactly would you approach a problem like this?  Furthermore, are there any specific tools or frameworks you'd recommend using.  Any input is welcome.  This is my first time doing a project which touches on artificial intelligence, specifically machine learning and NLP.</p>

Finding Similar Paragraphs in Different Documents,"<p>I am trying to figure out what type of analysis and currently available libraries there are out there to, when feed in two text paragraphs, determine if there is some degree of similarity between the two (whether with regards to subjects and verbs, or context).  I imagine there might be some NLP type analysis that could be done but seeing what experiences people have had in these solutions.</p>

<p>For example, consider the following two paragraphs:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Governing Law.  This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Missouri without reference to its conflict of law principles.</p></li>
<li><p>Law to Apply.  The laws of the State of Missouri shall apply to this Agreement.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>Fundamentally, I'd want the have those two clauses picked as identical.</p>

<p>I am looking for a library available under .Net.</p>
","c#, nlp","<p>Well that is an interesting question. You could use NLTK to extract the core concepts (Noun groups) and compare those directly. In this case you'd get:</p>

<ol>
<li>Governing Law, Agreement, Laws, State, Missouri, conflict, law principles</li>
<li>Law, laws, State, Missouri, Agreement</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, similarity is not bi-directional. Group 2 is fully represented in Group 1, but not the other way around. You could apply a harmonic mean where you count the percentage of a group in another group so G21 would be 1.0 and G12 would be 0.57. So the harmonic mean would be H = 2AB/(A+B) == 2(1.0)*(0.57)/(1.0 + 0.57) = 0.72.</p>

<p>Now, this isn't identical but in your example you wanted there to be a match between the two paragraphs. In this case their harmonic mean, H, is 0.72. The higher the number, the harder it is to achieve. H>0.8 is considered good. H>0.9 for most systems is exceptional. So what you must decide is where do you want your arbitrary line in the sand drawn? It has to be arbitrary because you haven't given a definition of the degree of similarity. So do you set it at 0.6, 0.7? How about 0.12948737? A good way of discovering this threshold is to take test examples and without doing the math just judge for yourself their similarity and then run the numbers and see what you come up with.</p>

How do I manipulate parse trees?,"<p>I've been playing around with natural language parse trees and manipulating them in various ways. I've been using Stanford's Tregex and Tsurgeon tools but the code is a mess and doesn't fit in well with my mostly Python environment (those tools are Java and aren't ideal for tweaking). I'd like to have a toolset that would allow for easy hacking when I need more functionality. Are there any other tools that are well suited for doing pattern matching on trees and then manipulation of those matched branches?</p>

<p>For example, I'd like to take the following tree as input:</p>

<pre><code>(ROOT
  (S
    (NP
      (NP (NNP Bank))
      (PP (IN of)
        (NP (NNP America))))
    (VP (VBD used)
      (S
        (VP (TO to)
          (VP (VB be)
            (VP (VBN called)
              (NP
                (NP (NNP Bank))
                (PP (IN of)
                  (NP (NNP Italy)))))))))))
</code></pre>

<p>and (this is a simplified example):</p>

<ol>
<li>Find any node with the label NP that has a first child with the label NP and some descendent named ""Bank"", and a second child with the label PP.</li>
<li>If that matches, then take all of the children of the PP node and move them to end of the matched NP's children.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, take this part of the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(NP
  (NP (NNP Bank))
  (PP (IN of)
    (NP (NNP America))))
</code></pre>

<p>and turn it into this:</p>

<pre><code>(NP
  (NP (NNP Bank) (IN of) (NP (NNP America))))
</code></pre>

Tool for creating own rules for word lemmatization and similar tasks,"<p>I'm doing a lot of natural language processing with a bit unsusual requirements. Often I get tasks <strong>similar to lemmatization</strong> - given a word (or just piece of text) I need to find some patterns and transform the word somehow. For example, I may need to correct misspellings, e.g. given word ""eatin"" I need to transform it to ""eating"". Or I may need to transform words ""ahahaha"", ""ahahahaha"", etc. to just ""ahaha"" and so on. </p>

<p>So I'm looking for some <strong>generic tool</strong> that allows to define <strong>transormation rules</strong> for such cases. Rules may look something like this:</p>

<pre><code> {w}in   -&gt;  {w}ing
 aha(ha)+  -&gt;  ahaha
</code></pre>

<p>That is I need to be able to use captured patterns from the left side on the right side.</p>

<p>I work with linguists who don't know programming at all, so <em>ideally</em> this tool should use <strong>external files</strong> and <strong>simple language for rules</strong>.</p>

<p>I'm doing this project in Clojure, so <em>ideally</em> this tool should be a library for one of JVM languages (Java, Scala, Clojure), but other languages or command line tools are ok too. </p>

<p>There are several very cool NLP projects, including <a href=""http://gate.ac.uk/"" rel=""nofollow"">GATE</a>, <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">Stanford CoreNLP</a>, <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow"">NLTK</a> and others, and I'm not expert in all of them, so I could miss the tool I need there. If so, please let me know. </p>

<p>Note, that I'm working with several languages and perform very different tasks, so concrete lemmatizers, stemmers, misspelling correctors and so on for concrete languages do not fit my needs - I really need more generic tool. </p>

<p><strong>UPD.</strong> It seems like I need to give some more details/examples of what I need. </p>

<p>Basically, I need a function for replacing text by some kind of regex (similar to Java's <code>String.replaceAll()</code>) but with possibility to <strong>use caught text in replacement string</strong>. For example, in real world text people often repeat characters to make emphasis on particular word, e.g. someoone may write ""This film is soooo boooring..."". I need to be able to replace these repetitive ""oooo"" with only single character. So there may be a rule like this (in syntax similar to what I used earlier in this post):</p>

<pre><code>{chars1}&lt;char&gt;+{chars2}?  -&gt;  {chars1}&lt;char&gt;{chars2}
</code></pre>

<p>that is, replace word starting with some chars (<code>chars1</code>), at least 3 chars  and possibly ending with some other chars (<code>chars2</code>) with similar string, but with only a single . Key point here is that we catch  on a left side of a rule and use it on a right side. </p>

What is the meaning of &quot;isolated symbol probabilities of English&quot;,"<p>In a note I found this phrase: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Using isolated symbol probabilities of English language, you can find out the entropy of the language.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What is actually meant by ""isolated symbol probabilities""? This is related to the entropy of an information source.</p>
","nlp, entropy","<p>It would be helpful to know where the note came from and what the context is, but even without that I am quite sure this simply means that they use the <em>frequency of individual symbols</em> (e.g. characters) as the basis for entropy, rather than for example the <em>joint probability</em> (of character <em>sequences</em>), or the <em>conditional probability</em> (of one particular character to follow another).</p>

<p>So if you have an alphabet X={a,b,c,...,z} and a probability P(a), P(b),... for each character to appear in text (e.g. based on the frequency found in a data example), you'd compute the entropy by computing -P(x) * log(P(x)) for each character x <em>individually</em> and then taking the sum of all. Then, obviously, you'd have used the probability of each character <em>in isolation</em>, rather than the probability of each character <em>in context</em>.</p>

<p>Note, however, that the term <em>symbol</em> in the note you found does not necessarily refer to characters. It might refer to <em>words</em> or other units of text. Nevertheless, the point they are making is that they apply the classical formula for entropy to <strong>probabilities of individual events</strong> (characters, words, whatever), <strong>not probabilities of complex or conditional events.</strong></p>

<p>Thanks.</p>
","java, parsing, tree, nlp","<p>I've done something similar in Python recently.  I'll address just the part about data structures:</p>

<p>Each part of speech is either a list of parts of speech (a non-terminal), or just a single word (a terminal).  So you could create classes something like:</p>

<pre><code>enum Type {
    Sentence,
    NounPhrase,
    VerbPhrase,
    Conjunction,
    ...
};

interface PartOfSpeech { };

class NonTerminal implements PartOfSpeech {
    Type type;
    List&lt;PartOfSpeech&gt; subparts;
};

class Terminal implements PartOfSpeech {
    String word;
};
</code></pre>

<p>This is relatively untyped: your program needs to construct only valid strutures of these (e.g. no making a VerbPhrase consisting of a list of Sentences -- you can do it but it's meaningless!).</p>

<p>The alternative route is to define a more explicit type system.  So you could define classes for each type of part of speech, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>class VerbPhrase {
    Verb verb;
    AdverbPhrase adverb; /* optional */
    ...
};
</code></pre>

<p>Since there are several ways of making a verb phrase, you could instead have classes for each type:</p>

<pre><code>interface VerbPhrase { };

class IntransitiveVerbPhrase implements VerbPhrase {
    Verb verb;
    AdverbPhrase adverb; /* optional */
};

class TransitiveVerbPhrase implements VerbPhrase {
    Verb verb;
    AdverbPhrase adverb; /* optional */
    NounPhrase obj;
};

<p>And so on.  The optimal degree of type explicitness at the Java level might not be obvious at the outset.  Start by writing something that handles simple sentences, and see how it feels.</p>

<p>In my case I created classes for each part of speech type, though each inherits from either a Terminal or Nonterminal.  Then I have rules for how you can construct each type.  This got kind of messy for some of them, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>add_rule(NounPhrase, [Noun])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [RelativeNounWord])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Noun, AdjectiveClause])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Article, Noun])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Article, Adjectives, Noun])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Article, Noun, AdjectiveClause])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Article, Adjectives, Noun, AdjectiveClause])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Adjectives, Noun])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Adjectives, Noun, AdjectiveClause])
add_rule(NounPhrase, [Article, Adjectives, Noun])
...
</code></pre>

<p>That's code for saying, ""a NounPhrase is a Noun.  Or, it's a RelativeNoun.  Or, it's a Noun followed by an AdjectiveClause.  Or, etc."".  There's a general parser which attempts to apply rules to a list of words until it gets a tree.  (You can see the messy and undocumented code at <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/source/browse/trunk/ircbot/nl.py"" rel=""nofollow"">http://code.google.com/p/ejrh/source/browse/trunk/ircbot/nl.py</a> .)</p>

<p>There's a certain amount of combinatorial explosion here.  It could possibly be improved by introducing new types of parts of speech, or just making some parts of it as optional: intead of having a rule for every possible combination of Article/Adjectives/AdjectiveClause/etc. present/absent, you could just make them optional.</p>

<p>My current approach to find the right order of columns is trying to recursively find each column's best position according to a word occurrence count criteria.</p>

<p>The pseudo-code of the algorithm's core I have in mind would be: </p>

<pre><code>function unscramble(scrambledMatrix,indexOfColumnIveJustMoved)
    for each column on scrambledMatrix as currentIndex=&gt;currentColumn
       if (currentIndex!=indexOfColumnIveJustMoved)
           maxRepeatedWords=0;maxIndex=0;
           for (i=0;i&lt;numberOfColumnsOfScrambledMatrix;i++)
              repWordsCount=countRepWords(moveFromToOn(currentIndex,i,scrambledMatrix))
              if (maxRepeatedWords&lt;repWordsCount)
                  maxRepeatedWords=repWordsCount;
                  maxIndex=i;
              endif
           endfor
           if (maxIndex!=currentIndex)
               return unscramble(moveFromToOn(currentIndex,maxIndex,scrambledMatrix),maxIndex); //recursive call
           endif
       endif
    endfor
    return(scrambledMatrix); //returns the unscrambled matrix;
endfunction
</code></pre>

<p>The algorithm stops when no column is moved after iterating on each one. I'm guessing it should work for any language (though I'm only interested on a solution for english) as long as the writing is based on words formed by letters and the sample is big enough.</p>

<p>Any suggestions on any other approaches or improvements? I would like to know the best solution for this problem (probably a dictionary based one looking for occurrences of common words instead? How about rebuilding the algorithm to avoid recursion, would it be much faster?).</p>
","sorting, nlp, text-recognition","<p>A couple more ideas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Quotes, for each open quote there must be an end quote after it.</li>
<li>Capital letters, usually start of sentence or noun etc (any additional grammar rules that apply</li>
<li>Use a small enough dictionary to fit all in memory, and count the number of valid words in a particular arrangement.</li>
</ul>

<p>One way, although generally this approach is one of the most time consuming- is to use a genetic algorithm.</p>

<p>Lets say the current default arrangement of columns is </p>

<pre><code>|de|  | f|Cl|nf|ed|au| i|ti|  |ma|ha|or|nn|ou| S|on|nd|on|
[0  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18] &lt;--- define this to be a chromosome
</code></pre>

<p>You could create a population of 100, 1000 w/e number of chromosomes that start off randomly assigned (keep in mind the 'random' assignment cannot have duplicate numbers and must be valid)</p>

<p>Then run a fitness function on each assignment, or multiple fitness functions if you would like to break it down that way. Start off with one super fitness function that assigns a fitness value to each assignment.</p>

<p>Only take the top 50% of chromosomes and move them onto the next generation, where you create 'children' chromosomes based on your choice of a crossover function and a probability of mutation- for this type of problem I recommend a very light crossover function (or none...) and a decent mutation rate. If you can find the columns that do not contribute to words/ the fitness function much then maybe flip those around.</p>

<p>Keep doing this for many generations and see how the top rated assignment looks like each generation, you would expect the valid to plateau at some point and that would be your correct assignment.</p>

<p>This approach could only be mildly better than brute force with fitness function, but it could also turn out to be pretty good.</p>

<p>One last idea: try to abstract away from 'first column, second column' and assign the columns into chunks that form words, because just because [1,4,6....] turns out to form ""the"" ""him"" ""her"" etc, doesnt mean it belongs right in the beginning.</p>

<p>I have a different approach that I kind of like better, I think a Dynamic Algorithm would be better suited for this.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT: Another Approach</strong></p>

<p>Again based on the dictionary approach, but you would focus on choosing the first few columns before the rest, and if it falls apart and you are not getting words in any particular row it means your earlier selections were wrong and you will need to backtrack.</p>

<p>Select row 1.. well chances are there are not too many words here but you will narrow yourself down to a subset of your dictionary- the subset that has words that start with the chars in your first column.</p>

<p>Now you have a row that works, select an adjacent row to the right. If it either forms full words or still has valid words possible (given no space is present signifying end of word). 
Repeat.</p>

<p>If no adjacent rows are possible given your previous choices, backtrack one row to the left, and dont select the same thing again.</p>

<p>The weakness here is that your dictionary would need to contain all the words in your sentence, as well as all variants of the words. You might need to come up with a heuristic similar to a fitness function that says, ""90% of words match, so this is still a valid attempt..."" or something of that sort.</p>

Identifying the components in a English sentence that do not make sense,"<p>I'm wondering is there an algorithm or a library which helps me identify the components in an English which has no meaning? e.g., <strong>very serious</strong> grammar error? If so, could you explain how it works, because I would really like to implement that or use that for my own projects.</p>

<p>Here's a random example:</p>

<p>In the sentence: ""I closed so etc page hello the door."" </p>

<p>As a human, we can quickly identify that [so etc page hello] does not make any sense. Is it possible for a machine to point out that the string does not make any sense and also contains grammar errors?</p>

<p>If there's such a solution, how precise can that be? Is it possible, for example, given a clip of an English sentence, the algorithm returns a measure, indicating how meaningful, or correct that clip is? Thank you very much!</p>

<p>PS: I've looked at CMU's link grammar as well as the NLTK library. But still I'm not sure how to use for example link grammar parser to do what I would like to do as the if the parser doesn't accept the sentence, I don't know how to tweak it to tell me which part it is not right.. and I'm not sure whether NLTK supported that.</p>

<p>Another thought I had towards solving the problem is to look at the frequencies of the word combination. Since I'm currently interested in correcting very serious errors only. If I define the ""serious error"" to be the cases where words in a clip of a sentence are rarely used together, i.e., the frequency of the combo should be much lower than those of the other combos in the sentence. </p>

<p>For instance, in the above example: [so etc page hello] these four words really seldom occur together. One intuition of my idea comes from when I type such combo in Google, no related results jump out. So is there any library that provides me such frequency information like Google does? Such frequencies may give a good hint on the correctness of the word combo.</p>

Using Sentiment Analysis to Detect Contradictory Arguments?,"<p>I don't have much background in sentiment analysis or natural language processing at all, but I have been reading a bit about it in my spare time.

<p>1) Find a thread that the original poster has defined a touchy political or religious topic.</p>

<p>2) For each comment categorize it as supporting the original poster or otherwise taking a contradicting or neutral stance.  </p>

Automatic negation of words,"<p>Consider the following statements</p>

<pre><code>We are not talking about a well established company in the NASDAQ
I will not initiate any trades until those clowns hammer out a deal
</code></pre>

<p>I am writing a simple Naive Bayes classifier, basically marking a training set of statements by hand (as either positive or negative sentiment) and storing the words that make up the statement accordingly.</p>

<p>Problem: if I mark both of these statements as having a negative sentiment, the words ""well"", ""established"" (statement 1) and ""any"", ""until"" (statement 2) would be indivudually marked as negatives. Whereas in another case (i.e., ""This company is performing well""), the same words (""well"" in this case) would be marked as a positive, making the sum of sentiment for ""well"" -1 + 1 = 0. I would overcome this by tagging these words as negated words, for example:</p>

<pre><code>We are talking about a not-well not-established company in the NASDAY.
I will initiate not-anymore trades not-until those clowns hammer out a deal

<p>Is there a standard or best way of tagging these kinds of words (I don't even know if they are of a same group of words)?

<p>Since English is not my mother language, I'm asking you if there's a common name for the words I have marked here and if what I want is (rudimentary) possible.

Clean and natural scripting functionality without parsing,"<p>I'm experimenting with creating a semi-natural scripting language, mostly for my own learning purposes, and for fun. The catch is that it needs to be in native C#, no parsing or lexical analysis on my part, so whatever I do needs to be able to be done through normal syntactical sugar.</p>

<p>I want it to read somewhat like a sentence would, so that it is easy to read and learn, especially for those that aren't especially fluent with programming, but I also want the full functionality of native code available to the user.</p>

<p>For example, in the perfect world it would look like a natural language (English in this case):</p>

<pre><code>When an enemy is within 10 units of player, the enemy attacks the player
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, allowing a sentence like this to actually do what the scripter intends would almost certainly require that this be a string that is run through a parser and lexical analyzer. My goal isn't that I have something this natural, and I don't want the scripter to be using strings to script. I want the scripter to have full access to C#, and have things like syntax highlighting, intellisense, debugging in IDE, etc. So what I'm trying to get it something that reads easily, but is in native C#. A couple of the major hurdles that I don't see a way to overcome is getting rid of periods <code>.</code>, commas <code>,</code>, and parentheses for empty methods <code>()</code>. For example, something like this is feasible but doesn't read very cleanly:</p>

<pre><code>// C#
When(Enemy.Condition(Conditions.isWithinDistance(Enemy, Player, 10))), Event(Attack(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>Using a language like Scala you can actually get much closer, because periods and parentheses can be replaced by a single whitespace in many cases. For example, you could take the above statement and make it look something like this in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>// Scala
When(Enemy is WithinDistance(Player, 10)) =&gt; Then(Attack From(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>This above code would actually compile assuming you setup your engine to handle it, in fact you might be able to coax further parentheses and commas out of this. Without the syntactical sugar in the above example it would be more like this, in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>// Scala (without syntactical sugar)
When(Enemy.is(WithinDistance(Player, 10)) =&gt; Then(Attack().From(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>The bottom line is I want to get as close as possible to something like the first scala example using native C#. It may be that there is really nothing I can do, but I'm willing to try any tricks that may be possible to make it read more natural, and get the periods, parentheses, and commas out of there (except when they make sense even in natural language).</p>

<p>I'm not as experienced with C# as other languages, so I might not know about some syntax tricks that are available, like macros in C++. Not that macros would actually be a good solution, they would probably cause more problems then they would solve, and would be a debugging nightmare, but you get where I'm going with this, at least in C++ it would be feasible. Is what I'm wanting even possible in C#?</p>

<p>Here's an example, using LINQ and Lambda expressions you can sometimes get the same amount of work done with fewer lines, less symbols, and code the reads closer to English. For example, here's an example of three collisions that happen between pairs of objects with IDs, we want to gather all collisions with the object that has ID 5, then sort those collisions by the ""first"" ID in the pair, and then output the pairs. Here is how you would do this without LINQ and/or Lambra expressions:</p>

<pre><code>struct CollisionPair : IComparable, IComparer

</code></pre>

<p>And now the same example with LINQ and Lambda. Notice in this example we don't have to both with making <code>CollisionPair</code> both <code>IComparable</code> and <code>IComparer</code>, and don't have to implement to the <code>Compare</code> and <code>CompareTo</code> methods:</p>

<pre><code>struct CollisionPair
{
    public int first;
    public int second;
}

static void Main( string[] args )
{           
    List&lt;CollisionPair&gt; collisions = new List&lt;CollisionPair&gt;
    {
        new CollisionPair { first = 1, second = 5 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 2, second = 3 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 5, second = 4 }
    };

    // In a script this would be all the code you needed, everything above
    // would be part of the game engine
    (from c in collisions 
    where ( c.first == 5 || c.second == 5 )
    orderby c.first select c).ForEach(c =&gt;
        Console.WriteLine(""Collision between "" + c.first +
                          "" and "" + c.second));
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the end we're left with a LINQ and Lambda expression that read closer to natural language, and are much less code for both a game engine and for the script. These kinds of changes are really what I'm looking for, but obviously LINQ and Lambda are both limited to specific syntax, not something as generic as I would like in the end.</p>
","c#, nlp","<p>Another approach would be to use FluentInterface ""pattern"", implement something like:</p>

<pre><code>When(enemy).IsWithin(10.units()).Of(player).Then(enemy).Attacks(player);
</code></pre>

<p>If you make the functions like When, IsWithin, Of, Then return some interfaces, then you will be able easily add new extension methods to expand your rules language.</p>

<p>For example let's take a look at function Then:</p>

<pre><code>public IActiveActor Then(this ICondition condition, Actor actor) {
   /* keep the actor, etc */
}

public void Attacks(this IActiveActor who, Actor whom) {
   /* your business logic */
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the future it would be easy to implement another function, say RunAway() without changing anything in your code:</p>

<pre><code>public void RunAway(this IActiveActor who) {
    /* perform runaway logic */
}
</code></pre>

<p>so it with this little addition you will be able to write:</p>

<pre><code>When(player).IsWithin(10.units()).Of(enemy).Then(player).RunAway();
</code></pre>

<p>Same for conditions, assuming When returns something like ICheckActor, you can introduce new conditions by simply defining new functions:</p>

<pre><code>public ICondition IsStrongerThan(this ICheckActor me, Actor anotherGuy) {
    if (CompareStrength(me, anotherGuy) &gt; 0)
       return TrueActorCondition(me);
    else
       return FalseActorCondition(me);
}
</code></pre>

<p>so now you can do:</p>

<pre><code>When(player)
  .IsWithin(10.units()).Of(enemy)
  .And(player).IsStrongerThan(enemy)
  .Then(player)
  .Attacks(enemy);
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>When(player)
  .IsWithin(10.units()).Of(enemy)
  .And(enemy).IsStrongerThan(player)
  .Then(player)
  .RunAway();

Override handling for basic/primitive types within a scope,"<p>I'd like to be able to make code that looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>30, 60, 90
</code></pre>

<p>And have it make a <code>List&lt;int&gt;</code> with those numbers in it. The problem is that in order to do this I believe I would need to be able to override how an <code>int</code> works within this scope. Is there any way that I could have my own ""Int"" class that could be used within a specific scope whenever a primitive constant like <code>30</code> was entered? If I'm unable to override <code>int</code> then the class must be used explicitly in this scope I'll end up with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>Int(30),Int(60),Int(90)
</code></pre>

<p>Which is still less code than the standard way:</p>

<pre><code>var nums = new List&lt;int&gt;(); nums.Add(30); nums.Add(60); nums.Add(90);
</code></pre>

<p>or even:</p>

<pre><code>var nums = new List&lt;int&gt;{ 30, 60, 90 };
</code></pre>

<p>I'm playing around with my own scripting language, for education purposes only, not intended for anyone else to use. I'm trying to see how far I can simplify syntax to read closer to a natural language. Is something like in first code block at the top of this question possible? If this is possible, can I extend it to other primitive types?</p>

<p>EDIT: I want something that is pure C#, I'm not doing my own parsing, or writing my own compiler. I'm curious if somehow I can have a primitive type like a constant int be handled through my own type instead? I don't think it's possible, but if not at least StackOverflow is good at giving alternatives I might not have thought about.</p>

<p>Ok, here's what I've come up with so far to get me closer:</p>

<pre><code>public static class Values
{
    static public List&lt;int&gt; Make(params int[] vals)
    {
        return vals.ToList();
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>This lets me do something like:</p>

<pre><code>var nums = Values.Make(30, 60, 90);
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, this isn't much shorter than <code>var nums = new List&lt;int&gt;{ 30, 60, 90 };</code> but it lets me abstract the int away so they could also do:</p>

<pre><code>var nums = Values.Make(30.0f, 60.0f, 90.0f);
</code></pre>

<p>So long as I make a handler for a list of floats. Unfortunately if I make a generic method, like this:</p>

<pre><code>public static List&lt;T&gt; Make&lt;T&gt;(params T[] vals) where T : IComparable&lt;T&gt;
{
    return vals.ToList();
}
</code></pre>

<p>Then it make the syntax of using it longer:</p>

<pre><code>var nums = Values.Make&lt;float&gt;(30.0f, 60.0f, 90.0f);
</code></pre>
","c#, nlp, overriding","<p>If you're on C# 4.0 you can simplify it to:</p>

<pre><code>var floats = new[] { 30.0f, 60.0f, 90.0f };
</code></pre>

<p>If you really need a <code>List&lt;T&gt;</code> then you can do:</p>

Detecting syllables in a word containing non-alphabetical characters,"<p>I'm implementing readability test and have implemented simple algorithm of detecting sylables.
Detecting sequences of vowels I'm counting them in words, for example word ""shoud"" contains one sequence of vowels which is 'ou'. Before I'm counting them i'm removing suffixes like -les, -e, -ed (for example word ""like"" contains one syllable but two sequences of vowels, so this method works).</p>

<li>A <code>'</code> with a vowel or word boundary on one side (<code>I'd</code>, <code>goin'</code>) seems not to do so (but note that <code>goin'</code> is still two syllables)</li>

","python, nlp, nltk","<p>You are making two errors here:</p>

<li><p>""NP"" isn't the only noun-phrase that NLTK uses. It also uses ""NNP"" and some others. You'll need to look into the tagset to figure out what there is. But I don't know what you're aiming for right now, so looking for just ""np"" may not be entirely wrong.</p></li>
<li><p>Your <code>noun(sen)</code> function doesn't <strong>always</strong> return something. It only returns if it find a word tagged ""np"" in your sentence. Now while it is a reasonable assumption that every sentence has a noun, consider that NLTK is not state-of-the-art and may therefore miss out on some nouns from time to time. Also, like I mentioned in (1), NLTK may also tag words with ""NNP"", so watch out.</p></li>

","python, nlp, nltk","<p>Can't really tell from what you've given us, but have you tried going into the problem step by step? It seems that under no circumstances does <code>t.split('/')[1] == 'NP'</code> evaluate to True. So you should start by:</p>

<li>print/debug to see what exactly does <code>f.split()</code> contain</li>

<p>Ok, first if that is really what <code>f.split()</code> prints to you then you should get an exception sicne <code>t</code> is a tuple and a tuple doesnt have a <code>split()</code> method.

  print f.split()

<p>So I have no ideea what you did there to get the result but it was incorrect. Now as you can see from the groups, the second part of the word is in lowercase, that is why your code failed. So if you do:</p>

<pre><code>w=[nltk.tag.str2tuple(t) for t in f.split() if t.split('/')[1].lower() == 'np']

<p>This will get you the result:</p>

How can I vary the sentence prefix &quot;I am working on [X]&quot; such that it has correct sentence structure for all X?,"<p>I want the user to be able to enter a task and I will prefix it appropriately such that it has correct sentence structure.</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<pre><code>I am working on [making the world a better place]
</code></pre>

<p>...sounds good.</p>

<pre><code>I am working on [discuss draft proposal]
</code></pre>

<p>...doesn't sound good. In this case it would want the program to respond with something like:</p>

<pre><code>I am discussing a draft proposal
</code></pre>

<p>Basically the way people write tasks or todos appears to be imperative (e.g. pick up milk, write essay, etc.) or simply a noun (e.g. assignment 1, client meeting, etc.). I want to convert these to <a href=""http://www.englishpage.com/verbpage/presentcontinuous.html"">Present Progressive</a> tense.</p>

<p>I am looking into the field of Natural Language Processing at the moment, but I was wondering if there was some sort of API available that would do what I need, or if someone has had experience with a similar problem.</p>
",nlp,"<p>In addition to natural language processing, you're also asking about natural language generation: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_generation</a></p>

<p>You can try to use a parser (like the <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/parser/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stanford parser</a>) to figure out which kind of phrase you have on hand and to identify the main verb if there is one.  You might just fall back on a part-of-speech tagger for this.  In English you'll also want to identify ""helping"" verbs (called ""auxiliaries"" in technical articles) like ""will"", ""may"", ""can"", etc. that often come right before the verb because these can change the tense as well.</p>

<p>If it's just a noun phrase, ""I'm working on X"" will likely sound okay.  If it's a nominal, (if the Stanford parser gives you only NNs without any NPs or NNPs or DETs inside the top NP), then it might sound better with an article attached.  E.g. ""pepper project"" -> ""I'm working on <em>the</em> pepper project"".  You wouldn't do that for ""Pepper's project"" or if it's already ""the pepper project"", or for most proper nouns.  There are always tricky cases though.</p>

<p>If it's a verb phrase:
If it's already progressive, great. Else:</p>

<p>Use a lemmatizer (or fall back on a stemmer) to get the root form of the main verb.<br>
Expand that root form into the present progressive.  For this, probably a few heuristics will suffice, based on whether or not the lemma ends in a vowel or a consonant that gets doubled.  E.g. ""walk"" -> ""walking"", ""run"" -> ""running"" (double n), ""fly"" -> ""flying"" (y doesn't behave like a vowel in this case), ""glide"" -> ""gliding"" (drop the last e after a consonant), but ""flee"" -> ""fleeing"" (not after a vowel).  The most comprehensive place to look for regularities and exceptions is the <a href=""https://rads.stackoverflow.com/amzn/click/com/0582517346"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Comprehensive Grammar of the English Language</a> or a similar online resource.  Tools for this include <a href=""http://www.informatics.sussex.ac.uk/research/groups/nlp/carroll/morph.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">morphg</a> and <a href=""http://morphadorner.northwestern.edu/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">MorphAdorner</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, remove any helper verbs and substitute the present progressive form for the main verb.  While this won't be perfect, it'll probably look smarter than most.</p>

<p>If it's an entire clause (sentence-like thing with a subject too) or a question, or some other larger thing, you might cop out and just use a generic prefix, like ""Right now: Has Jenn gotten back to me?""  ""Right now: I must head out!""</p>

<p>I'm not an expert, so I may have missed some tools already out there for this kind of thing, and if so, I hope to learn that from others.  It's not an easy thing to do, but it sounds pretty useful.  There will always be mistakes, and they might be jarring to your users, or perhaps they'll find the oddities endearing.  If you put something together, will you post the API here?</p>

<p>I separated first name and last name because I envisaged that it would work by initially extracting cases where <code>lastName == firstName</code> then ording by date. I then tough that I could use  case where lastName was in firstName and other consitions were met.</p>

Tree traversing or what?,"<p>In Python, I'm writing a Natural Language Processing module and can't work out how to code a function to do the following.
Input: a list of parts of speech (POS) derived from an inputted sentence as short strings. Some items in the list are themselves lists because that part of the program doesn't know which part of speech to choose out of two or more possibles.
e.g. a particular six word sentence results in <code>[""DET"", ""NOUN"", [""VERB"", ""NOUN""], ""CONJ"", [""ADJ"", ""ADV"", ""NOUN""], ""ADV""]</code>
i.e the first word is definitely a DET
the 2nd word is definitely a NOUN
the 3rd word could be a VERB or a NOUN
the 4th word is definitely a CONJ
the 5th word could be a ADJ, ADV or NOUN
the 6th word is definitely a ADV.</p>

<p>So INPUT = <code>[""DET"", ""NOUN"", [""VERB"", ""NOUN""], ""CONJ"", [""ADJ"", ""ADV"", ""NOUN""], ""ADV""]</code></p>

<p>I need the function to return each possible combination as a list of lists. So the return value for the above should be:</p>

 [""DET"", ""NOUN"", ""NOUN"", ""CONJ"", ""ADV"", ""ADV""],
 [""DET"", ""NOUN"", ""NOUN"", ""CONJ"", ""ADJ"", ""ADV""],

<p>The core idea is on line 3 and 4: on line 3 it split text in sentences and iterates them. 
On line 4, it splits the sentence in tokens, it runs <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging"" rel=""nofollow"">""part of speech"" tagging</a> on the sentence, and then it feeds the pos-tagged sentence to the named entity recognition algorithm.

"How can I tweak Levenshtein distance in classifying linguistically similar words (e.g. verb tenses, adjective comparisons, singular and plural)","<p>I am out of ideas on how to complete this task. I am counting the frequency of a word, actually the base form of the word (e.g. running will be counted as run).

<p>I also tried the double Metaphone, but it isn't what I'm looking for.</p>

<p>So, please give me some ideas on how to tweak Levenshtein distance algorithm in classifying linguistically similar words since the algorithm is only for determining the number of edits needed not considering if they are linguistically similar or not</p>

<p>Example:
1. ""running"" will be counted as one occurrence of the word ""run""
2. ""word"" will likewise be an occurrence of ""word""
3. ""fear"" will NOT be counted as an occurrence of ""gear""</p>

<p>Also, I am implementing it in C#.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>Edit: I edited it as Rene suggested.
Another note:
I am trying to consider to consider if a word is a substring of another word but that implementation will not be as much dynamic.
Another idea I think is: ""if adding -s or -ing to string1, string1 == string2, then string2 is an occurrence of string1."" However, this is not the case as some words have irregular plurals.</p>

Noun Type Determination in Java,"<p>I am currently working on a project where I need to create possible answers to WH question based on a given sentence.</p>

<p>Example sentence is:</p>

<pre><code>Anna went to the store.
</code></pre>

<p>I need to create possible answers to the following questions.</p>

<pre><code>Who went to the store?
Where did ana go?
</code></pre>

<p>I had already implemented the POST-Tagging of the words and I now know the Part of Speech of the word.</p>

<p>I had difficulty on determining what type of noun is the word if it is a noun so I can create a template for my answer.</p>

<p>Example is:</p>

<pre><code>Anna - noun - person: possible answer to question who.

Store - noun - place: possible answer to question where.
</code></pre>

<p>I want to implement this using java</p>
","java, nlp","<p>You should not try to infer possible questions and their answers from the nouns present in a sentence. Instead, you should infer the type of questions you can ask from the activity described by the verb. In your example, the system should infer that the activity of going requires a subject who goes (possible answer to the ""who"" question), a place where the subject goes (possible answer to the ""where to"" question) as well as the time when the subject went there (possible answer to the ""when"" question) and potentially more (from where? with whom? by what means? which way? etc). Then it should check which answers are provided in the question. In your example, answers to ""who"" and ""where"" are provided, but ""when"" is not. In other words, you should have a mapping from verbs to questions that make sense for each verb.</p>

<p>Then for each question applicable to the verb you should store prepositions that are used to indicate that answer in a sentence. For example, the answer to the ""where to"" question is often preceded by ""to"" and an answer to ""when"" question is often preceded by ""at"" or ""on"". Note that subject (here answer to the ""who"" question) needs special treatment. Also, some verbs can be immediately followed by an object without prepositions and your verb dataset should indicate the question to which they constitute an answer. For example the verb ""to enter"" can be followed by an object which answer the ""where/what"" question as in ""Anna entered the room"". Also, some nouns are exceptions and are never preceded by a preposition. For example ""home"" as in ""Anna went home"". You need to treat these specially as well. Another thing to watch out for are idiomatic expressions like ""Anna went to great lengths"". Again, special treatment is required. </p>

<p>Generally, nouns in English do not have enough structure to allow you to determine what type of thing (e.g. a place, an object, a person, a concept etc) they denote. You would need to have a large dataset that breaks up all the words known to the system into different categories. If you do use a noun set like this, it should have a supporting role to increase system's accuracy.</p>

<p>Relying on verbs and prepositions is far more flexible as it allows the system to handle unknown expressions. For example, someone might say ""Anna went to Bob"", but ""Bob"" is not a place. System that infers the role of each element from verb and preposition still handles this situation and properly treats ""Bob"" as the right answer for the ""where to"" question. </p>

Determining the Similarity Between Items in a Database,"<p>We have a database with hundreds of millions of records of log data. We're attempting to 'group' this log data as being likely to be of the same nature as other entries in the log database. For instance:</p>

<p>Record X may contain a log entry like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change Transaction ABC123 Assigned To Server US91</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Record Y may contain a log entry like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change Transaction XYZ789 Assigned To Server GB47</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To us humans those two log entries are easily recognizable as being likely related in some way. Now, there may be 10 million rows between Record X and Record Y. And there may be thousands of other entries that are similar to X and Y, and some that are totally different but that have other records they are similar to.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to determine is the best way to group the similar items together and say that with XX% certainty Record X and Record Y are probably of the same nature. Or perhaps a better way of saying it would be that the system would look at Record Y and say based on your content you're most like Record X as apposed to all other records.</p>

<p>I've seen some mentions of Natural Language Processing and other ways to find similarity between strings (like just brute-forcing some Levenshtein calculations) - however for us we have these two additional challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is machine generated - not human generated</li>
<li>As opposed to a search engine approach where we determine results for a given query - we're trying to classify a giant repository and group them by how alike they are to one another.</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for your input!</p>
","artificial-intelligence, nlp, search-engine, data-mining, full-text-indexing","<p>Interesting problem.  Obviously, there's a scale issue here because you don't really want to start comparing each record to every other record in the DB.  I believe I'd look at growing a list of ""known types"" and scoring records against the types in that list to see if each record has a match in that list.</p>

<p>The ""scoring"" part will hopefully draw some good answers here -- your ability to score against known types is key to getting this to work well, and I have a feeling you're in a better position than we are to get that right.  Some sort of soundex match, maybe?  Or if you can figure out how to ""discover"" which parts of new records change, you could define your known types as regex expressions.</p>

<p>At that point, for each record, you can hopefully determine that you've got a match (with high confidence) or a match (with lower confidence) or very likely no match at all.  In this last case, it's likely that you've found a new ""type"" that should be added to your ""known types"" list.  If you keep track of the score for each record you matched, you could also go back for low-scoring matches and see if a better match showed up later in your processing.</p>

<p>As such, one high-level algorithm would be to collect multiple examples of the same page type and deduce parsing (or extraction) rules for the parts of the page which are different (this is likely to be the main topic).  The intuition is that common boilerplate (header, footer, etc) and ads will eventually appear on multiple examples of those web pages, so by training on a few of them, you can quickly start to reliably identify this boilerplate/additional code and subsequently ignore it.

Regular expression to match object dimensions,"<p>I'll put it right out there: I'm terrible with regular expressions. I've tried to come up with one to solve my problem but I really don't know much about them. . .</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>Hello blah blah. It's around 11 1/2"" x 32"".</li>
  <li>The dimensions are 8 x 10-3/5!</li>

  <li>I think about 13/19"".</li>
  <li>No, it's probably 86 cm actually.</li>
  </ul>

<p>I want to, as cleanly as possible, extract item dimensions from within these sentences. In a perfect world the regular expression would output the following:</p>

  <li>11 1/2"" x 32""</li>
  <li>8 x 10-3/5</li>
  <li>22"" x 17""</li>

  <li>5.76 by 8</li>
  <li>84cm</li>
  <li>13/19""</li>
  <li>86 cm</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I imagine a world where the following rules apply:</p>

<ul>
<li>The following are valid units: <code>{cm, mm, yd, yards, "", ', feet}</code>, though I'd prefer a solution that considers an arbitrary set of units rather than an explicit solution for the above units.</li>
<li>A dimension is always described numerically, may or may not have units following it and may or may not have a fractional or decimal part. Being made up of a fractional part on it's own is allowed, e.g., <code>4/5""</code>.</li>
<li>Fractional parts always have a <code>/</code> separating the numerator / denominator, and one can assume there is no space between the parts (though if someone takes that in to account that's great!).</li>
<li>Dimensions may be one-dimensional or two-dimensional, in which case one can assume the following are acceptable for separating two dimensions: <code>{x, by}</code>. If a dimension is only one-dimensional it <strong>must</strong> have units from the set above, i.e., <code>22 cm</code> is OK, <code>.333</code> is not, nor is <code>4.33 oz</code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>To show you how useless I am with regular expressions (and to show I at least tried!), I got this far. . .</p>

<pre><code>[1-9]+[/ ][x1-9]

<p><strong>Update (2)</strong></p>

<p>You guys are very fast and efficient! I'm going to add an extra few of test cases that haven't been covered by the regular expressions below:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>The last but one test case is 12 yd x.</li>
  <li>The last test case is 99 cm by.</li>
  <li>This sentence doesn't have dimensions in it: 342 / 5553 / 222.</li>
  <li>Three dimensions? 22"" x 17"" x 12 cm</li>
  <li>This is a product code: c720 with another number 83 x better.  </li>
  <li>A number on its own 21.</li>
  <li>A volume shouldn't match 0.332 oz.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>These should result in the following (# indicates nothing should match):</p>

<blockquote>
  <ul>
  <li>12 yd</li>
  <li>99 cm</li>
  <li>#</li>
  <li>22"" x 17"" x 12 cm</li>
  <li>#</li>

translate by replacing words inside existing text,"<p>What are common approaches for translating certain words (or expressions) inside a given text, when the text must be reconstructed (with punctuations and everythin.) ?</p>

<p>The translation comes from a lookup table, and covers words, collocations, and emoticons like L33t, CUL8R, :-), etc.</p>

<p>Simple string search-and-replace is not enough since it can replace part of longer words (cat > dog  â >  caterpillar > dogerpillar).</p>

<p>Assume the following input:</p>

<pre><code>s = ""dogbert, started a dilbert dilbertion proces cat-bert :-)""
</code></pre>

<p>after translation, i should receive something like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>result = ""<strong>anna</strong>, started a <strong>george</strong> dilbertion <strong>process</strong> cat-bert <strong>smiley</strong>""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I can't simply tokenize, since i loose <strong>punctuations</strong> and <strong>word positions</strong>. </p>

<p>Regular expressions, works for normal words, but don't catch special expressions like the smiley :-) but it does .</p>

<pre><code>re.sub(r'\bword\b','translation',s) ==&gt; translation
re.sub(r'\b:-\)\b','smiley',s) ==&gt; :-)
</code></pre>

<p>for now i'm using the above mentioned regex, and simple replace for the non-alphanumeric words, but it's far from being bulletproof.</p>

<p>(p.s. i'm using python)</p>
","python, regex, language-agnostic, string, nlp","<p>I had a similar problem with standard emoticons to be replaced with values. <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_emoticons"" rel=""nofollow"">Here</a> is a list of emoticons.

<pre><code>:[        -1

:(          -1
:)         1

<p>Then read it into a dictionary</p>

<pre><code>def mark_emoticons(t):

<p>A similar function to read it to dictionary slangs{} and a similar function to replace the slangs.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>As of now, I've written a dumb parser that handles all the easy stuff (playID, quarter, time, down&amp;distance, offensive team) along with some scripts that goes and gets this data and sanitizes it into the format seen above. A single line gets turned into a ""Play"" object to be stored into a database.</p>

<p>The tough part here (for me at least) is parsing the description of the play.  Here is some information that I would like to extract from that string:</p>

<p>Example string:</p>

<pre><code>""Mark Sanchez pass to the left to Shonn Greene for 7 yards to the NYJ44. Tackled by Mike Jenkins.""
</code></pre>

<p>Result:</p>

<pre><code>turnover = False
interception = False
fumble = False
to_on_downs = False
passing = True
rushing = False
direction = 'left'
loss = False
penalty = False
scored = False
TD = False
PA = False
FG = False
TPC = False
SFTY = False
punt = False
kickoff = False
ret_yardage = 0
yardage_diff = 7
playmakers = ['Mark Sanchez', 'Shonn Greene', 'Mike Jenkins']
</code></pre>

<p>The logic that I had for my initial parser went something like this:</p>

<pre><code># pass, rush or kick
# gain or loss of yards
# scoring play
    # Who scored? off or def?
    # TD, PA, FG, TPC, SFTY?
# first down gained
# punt?
# kick?
    # return yards?
# penalty?
    # def or off?
# turnover?
    # INT, fumble, to on downs?
# off play makers
# def play makers
</code></pre>

<p>The descriptions can get pretty hairy (multiple fumbles &amp; recoveries with penalties, etc) and I was wondering if I could take advantage of some NLP modules out there. Chances are I'm going to spend a few days on a dumb/static state-machine like parser instead but if anyone has suggestions on how to approach it using NLP techniques I'd like to hear about them.</p>

<p>If you're interested in the meaning of text, well, that's the Next Big Thing. Semantic search engines are predicted as initiating Web 3.0, but we're far from 'there' yet. Extracting logic from a text is dependant on several steps:</p>

<ul>
<li>Tokenization, Chunking</li>
<li>Disambiguation on a lexical level (Time flies like an arrow, but fruit flies like a banana.)</li>
<li>Syntactic Parsing</li>
<li>Morphological analysis (tense, aspect, case, number, whatnot)</li>
</ul>

<p>A small list, off the top of my head. There's more :-), and many more details to each point. For example, when I say ""parsing"", what is this? There are <em>many</em> different parsing algorithms, and there are just as many parsing formalisms. Among the most powerful are <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Tree_adjoining_grammar"" rel=""noreferrer"">Tree-adjoining grammar</a> and <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/HPSG"" rel=""noreferrer"">Head-driven phrase structure grammar</a>. But both of them are hardly used in the field (for now). Usually, you'll be dealing with some half-baked generative approach, and will have to conduct morphological analysis yourself.</p>

<p>Going from there to semantics is a big step. A Syntax/Semantics interface is dependant both, on the syntactic <em>and</em> semantic framework employed, and there is no single working solution yet. On the semantic side, there's classic generative semantics, then there is <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Discourse_Representation_Theory"" rel=""noreferrer"">Discourse Representation Theory</a>, <a href=""http://staff.science.uva.nl/~stokhof/papers.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">dynamic semantics</a>, and many more. Even the logical formalism everything is based on is still not well-defined. Some say one should use first-order logic, but that hardly seems sufficient; then there is intensional logic, as used by Montague, but that seems overly complex, and computationally unfeasible. There also is dynamic logic (Groenendijk and Stokhof have pioneered this stuff. Great stuff!) and very recently, this summer actually, <a href=""http://home.medewerker.uva.nl/j.a.g.groenendijk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Jeroen Groenendijk</a> presented a new formalism, <em>Inquisitive</em> <em>Semantics</em>, also very interesting.</p>

<p>If you want to get started on a very simple level, read <a href=""http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/jbos/comsem/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Blackburn and Bos (2005)</a>, it's great stuff, and the de-facto introduction to Computational Semantics! I recently extended their system to cover the partition-theory of questions (question answering is a beast!), as proposed by Groenendijk and Stokhof (1982), but unfortunately, the theory has a complexity of O(nÂ²) over the domain of individuals. While doing so, I found B&amp;B's implementation to be a bit, erhmâ¦ hackish, at places. Still, it is going to really, really help you dive into computational semantics, and it is still a very impressive showcase of what can be done. Also, they deserve extra cool-points for implementing a grammar that is settled in Pulp Fiction (the movie).</p>

<p>And while I'm at it, pick up Prolog. A lot of research in computational semantics is based on Prolog. <a href=""http://www.coli.uni-saarland.de/~kris/learn-prolog-now/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Learn Prolog Now!</a> is a good intro. I can also recommend ""The Art of Prolog"" and Covington's ""Prolog Programming in Depth"" and ""Natural Language Processing for Prolog Programmers"", the former of which is available for free online.</p>

Natural Language processing for getting qualitative info,"<p>I have a requirement for which I do not know if NL can do it. Plz advise.</p>

",nlp,"<p>Yes, Natural Language Processing methods <em>can</em> do what you ask for:</p>

<p>To find out which are the ""nouns"" in a text is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pos-tagging"" rel=""noreferrer"">POS-Tagging</a>.
Identifying the syntactical strucure of sentences is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing#Human_languages"" rel=""noreferrer"">parsing</a>. Depending on your parsing method and how strict the syntax of the language is you might want to look into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_role_labeling"" rel=""noreferrer"">semantic role labeling</a> aswell to find subjects/objects in a sentence. Classifying the polarity (positive/negative) of a statement is called <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis"" rel=""noreferrer"">sentiment analysis</a>.</p>

<p>The Python <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""noreferrer"">NLTK</a> provides some tools you can get started with, but sentiment analysis is an active research area and a task where a lot of other NLP-methods have to work together, so it is certainly not the easiest field to get started with in NLP.

using Dependency Parser in Stanford coreNLP,"<p>I am using the Stanford coreNLP ( <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml"" rel=""nofollow"">http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/corenlp.shtml</a> ) in order to parse sentences and extract dependencies between the words.</p>

<p>I have managed to create the dependencies graph like in the example in the supplied link, but I don't know how to work with it. I can print the entire graph using the <code>toString()</code> method, but the problem I have is that the methods that search for certain words in the graph, such as <code>getChildList</code>, require an IndexedWord object as a parameter. Now, it is clear why they do because the nodes of the graph are of IndexedWord type, but it's not clear to me how I create such an object in order to search for a specific node.</p>

<p>For example: I want to find the children of the node that represents the word ""problem"" in my sentence. How I create an IndexWord object that represents the word ""problem"" so I can search for it in the graph?</p>
","nlp, stanford-nlp","<p>In general, you shouldn't be creating your own IndexedWord objects. (These are used to represent ""word tokens"", i.e., particular words in a text, not ""word types"", and so asking for the word ""problem"" -- a word type -- isn't really valid; in particular, a sentence could have multiple tokens of this word type.)</p>

<p>There are a couple of convenience methods that let you do what you want:</p>

<ul>
<li>sg.getNodeByWordPattern(String pattern)</li>
<li>sg.getAllNodesByWordPattern(String pattern)</li>
</ul>

<p>The first is a little dangerous, since it just returns the first IndexedWord matching the pattern, or null if there are none.  But it's most directly what you asked for.</p>

<p>Some other methods to start from are:</p>

<ul>
<li>sg.getFirstRoot() to find the (first, usually only) root of the graph and then to navigate down from there, such as by using the sg.getChildren(root) method.</li>
<li>sg.vertexSet() to get all of the IndexWord objects in the graph.</li>
<li>sg.getNodeByIndex(int) if you already know the input sentence, and therefore can ask for words by their integer index.</li>
</ul>

<p>Commonly these methods leave you iterating through nodes. Really, the first two get...Node... methods just do the iteration for you.  </p>

IR and QA - Beginner Project Scope,"<p>I have been brainstorming for an Undergraduate Project in Question Answering domain. A project that has components of IR and NLP.</p>

<p>The first thing that popped up, was of course factoid question answering, but that seemed to be an already conquered problem. #IBM Watson!</p>

<p>Non-factoid QA seems interesting, so I took it up. Now, we are in scope-it-out phase of the project description. So, from the ambitious goal - of answering any question put up by the user - I need to scope out our project.    </p>

<p>So I took the following decisions: </p>

<ol>
<li>It will be closed-domain - C++ Programming</li>
<li>The corpus will consist of just one website. (cplusplus or wikipedia) or just one document (the complete reference)</li>
<li>We will develop only one module of the entire QA architecture - Passage Retrieval or Answer Extraction.</li>
</ol>

<ul>
<li>ROC is for binary classifiers only. If you have three classes, you can measure the performance of your positive and negative class separately (by counting the other two classes as 0, like you proposed).</li>
<li>The library expects the output of a decision function as the second value of each tuple. It then tries all possible thresholds, e.g. f(x) >= 0.8 => classify as 1, and plots a point for each threshold (that's why you get a curve in the end). So if your classifier guesses class 0, you actually want a value closer to zero. That's why I proposed <code>.prob(1)</code></li>

","algorithm, puzzle, nlp","<p>This is a basic <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transposition_cipher"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">transposition cipher</a>.  My question above was simply to determine if it was a transposition cipher or a substitution cipher.  Cryptanalysis of such systems is fairly straightforward.  Others have already alluded to basic methods.  Optimal approaches will attempt to place the hardest and rarest letters first, as these will tend to uniquely identify the letters around them, which greatly reduces the subsequent search space.  Simply finding <em>a</em> place to place an ""a"" (no pun intended) is not hard, but finding a location for a ""q"", ""z"", or ""x"" is a bit more work.</p>

<p>The overarching goal for an algorithm's quality isn't to decipher the text, as it can be done by better than brute force methods, nor is it simply to be fast, but it should eliminate possibilities <em>absolutely as fast as possible</em>.</p>

<p>Since you can use multiple strings simultaneously, attempting to create words from the rarest characters is going to allow you to test dictionary attacks in parallel.  Finding the correct placement of the rarest terms in each string as quickly as possible will decipher that ciphertext PLUS all of the others at the same time.</p>

<p>If you search for cryptanalysis of transposition ciphers, you'll find a bunch with genetic algorithms. These are meant to advance the research cred of people working in GA, as these are not really optimal in practice.  Instead, you should look at some basic optimizatin methods, such as branch and bound, A*, and a variety of statistical methods. (How deep you should go depends on your level of expertise in algorithms and statistics. :)  I would switch between deterministic methods and statistical optimization methods several times.) </p>

<p>In any case, the calculations should be <em>dirt cheap</em> and fast, because the scale of initial guesses could be quite large.  It's best to have a cheap way to filter out a LOT of possible placements first, then spend more CPU time on sifting through the better candidates.  To that end, it's good to have a way of describing the stages of processing and the computational effort for each stage.  (At least that's what I would expect if I gave this as an interview question.)</p>

It's not a great reference set of slides, but it's readily accessible.

I mean, is the topic distributions being provided by MALLET a suitable metric to track the popularity of the topics over time if during the model building stage, we only provide a subset of the dataset I am required to analyze.</p>

","nlp, mallet","<p>Are you famailiar with <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Latent_semantic_indexing"" rel=""nofollow"">Latent Semantic Indexing</a>? Latent Dirichlet Analysis is just a different way of doing the same kind of thing, so LSI or <a href=""http://www.cs.brown.edu/~th/papers/Hofmann-SIGIR99.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"">pLSI</a> you may be an easier starting point to gain knowledge about the goals of LDA.</p>

<p>All three techniques lock on to topics in an unsupervised fashion (you tell it how many topics to look for), and then assume that each document covers each topic in varying proportions. Depending on how many topics you allocate, they may behave more like <em>subfields</em> of whatever your corpus is about, and may not be as specific as the ""topics"" that people think about when they think about trending topics in the news.</p>

<p>Somehow I suspect that you want to assume that each document represents a particular topic. LSI/pLSI/LDA don't do this -- they model each document as a mixture of topics. That doesn't mean you won't get good results, or that this isn't worth trying, but I suspect (though I don't have a comprehensive knowledge of LSI literature) that you'd be tackling a brand new research problem.</p>

Incrementally Trainable Entity Recognition Classifier,"<p>I'm doing some semantic-web/nlp research, and I have a set of sparse records, containing a mix of numeric and non-numeric data, representing entities labeled with various features extracted from simple English sentences.</p>

<p>A single entity may appear more than once (but with a different UID each time), and may have overlapping features with its other occurrences. A second data set represents which of the above UIDs are definitely the same.</p>

<p>What algorithm(s) would I use to <strong>incrementally</strong> train a classifier that could take a set of features, and instantly recommend the N most similar UIDs and probability of whether or not those UIDs actually represent the <strong>same</strong> entity? Optionally, I'd also like to get a recommendation of missing features to populate and then re-classify to get a more certain matches.</p>

<p>I researched traditional approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. such as <a href=""http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN"" rel=""nofollow"">FLANN</a> and <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.ann"" rel=""nofollow"">ANN</a>, and I don't think these would be appropriate since they're not trainable (in a supervised learning sense) nor are they typically designed for sparse non-numeric input.</p>

<p>As a very naive first-attempt, I was thinking about using a naive bayesian classifier, by converting each SameAs relation into a set of training samples. So, for each entity A with B sameas relations, I would iterate over each and train the classifier like:</p>

<pre><code>classifier = Classifier()
for entity,sameas_entities in sameas_dataset:
    entity_features = get_features(entity)
    for other_entity in sameas_entities:
        other_entity_features = get_features(other_entity)
        classifier.train(cls=entity, ['left_'+f for f in entity_features] + ['right_'+f for f in other_entity_features])
        classifier.train(cls=other_entity, ['left_'+f for f in other_entity_features] + ['right_'+f for f in entity_features])
</code></pre>

<p>And then use it like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print classifier.findSameAs(dict(speaker=997, session=8945305, sentence=32, obj_called='salty',isa='cat',eats='mice'), n=7)
[(1.0, '23432424'),(0.999, 'io43po5', (1.0, '2l3jk42'), (1.0, 'sdf90s8df'), (0.76, 'jerwljk'), (0.34, 'rlekwj32424'), (0.08, '09843jlk')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print classifier.findSameAs(dict(isa='cat',eats='mice'), n=7)
[(0.09, '23432424'), (0.06, 'jerwljk'), (0.03, 'rlekwj32424'), (0.001, '09843jlk')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print classifier.findMissingFeatures(dict(isa='cat',eats='mice'), n=4)

Most efficient way to generate a list of Unigrams from a text field in MongoDB,"<p>I need to generate a vector of unigrams, i.e. a vector of all the unique words which appear in a specific text field that I have stored as part of a broader JSON object in MongoDB.</p>

<p>I'm not really sure what's the easiest and most efficient way to generate this vector. I was thinking of writing a simple Java app which could handle the tokenization (using something like OpenNLP), however I think that a better approach may be to try to tackle this using Mongo's Map-Reduce feature... However I'm not really sure how I could go about this. </p>

<p>Another option would be to use Apache Lucene indexing, but it would mean I'd still need to export this data in one by one. Which is really the same issue I would have with the custom Java or Ruby approach... </p>

<p>Map reduce sounds good however the Mongo data is growing by the day as more document are inserted. This isn't really a one off task as there are new documents being added all the time. Updates are very rare. I really don't want to run a Map-Reduce over the millions of documents every time I want to update my Unigram vector as I fear this will be very inefficient use of resources... </p>

<p>For the given dataset, you can use the following javascript code to get to your solution. The collection ""<strong>authors_unigrams</strong>"" contains the result. All the code is supposed to be run using mongo console (http://www.mongodb.org/display/DOCS/mongo+-+The+Interactive+Shell).</p>

<p><strong>First</strong>, we need to mark of all the new documents that have come afresh into the <strong>'stories'</strong> collection. We do it using following command. It will add a new attribute called ""mr_status"" into each document and assign value ""inprocess"". Later, we will see that map-reduce operation will only take those documents in account which are having the value ""inprocess"" for the field ""mr_status"". This way, we can avoid reconsidering all the documents for map-reduce operation that have been already considered in any of the previous attempt, making the operation efficient as  asked.</p>

<pre><code>db.stories.update({mr_status:{$exists:false}},{$set:{mr_status:""inprocess""}},false,true);
</code></pre>

<p><strong>Second</strong>, we define both <strong>map()</strong> and <strong>reduce()</strong> function. </p>

<pre><code>var map = function() {
        uniqueWords = function (words){
            var arrWords = words.split("" "");

                    seenWords[arrWords[i]]=true;
                    arrNewWords.push(arrWords[i]);
                }
            }
            return arrNewWords;
        }
      var unigrams =  uniqueWords(this.body) ;
      emit(this.author, {unigrams:unigrams});

var reduce = function(key,values){

    Array.prototype.uniqueMerge = function( a ) {
        for ( var nonDuplicates = [], i = 0, l = a.length; i&lt;l; ++i ) {
            if ( this.indexOf( a[i] ) === -1 ) {
                nonDuplicates.push( a[i] );
            }
        }
        return this.concat( nonDuplicates )
    };

    unigrams = [];
    values.forEach(function(i){
        unigrams = unigrams.uniqueMerge(i.unigrams);
    });
    return { unigrams:unigrams};
};

<p><strong>Third</strong>, we actually run the map-reduce function.</p>

<pre><code>var result  = db.stories.mapReduce( map,
                                  reduce,
                                  {query:{author:{$exists:true},mr_status:""inprocess""},
                                   out: {reduce:""authors_unigrams""}
                                  });

<p><strong>Fourth</strong>, we mark all the records that have been considered for map-reduce in last run as processed by setting ""mr_status"" as ""processed"".</p>

<pre><code>db.stories.update({mr_status:""inprocess""},{$set:{mr_status:""processed""}},false,true);

Using Natural Language Processing to parse websites,"<p>I'm interested generally in the data mining by crawling websites, but I've never been able to find a lot of documentation on the process I'd really like to implement.

Then, I could run the tool and tell it which menu items it parsed out correctly, and which ones were wrong. The tool would then ""learn"" from these corrections, and the next time I run it, I'd get better results.</p>

How to parse a list of words according to a simplified grammar?,"<p>Just to clarify, this isn't homework. I've been asked for help on this and am unable to do it, so it turned into a personal quest to solve it.</p>

<p>Imagine you have a grammar for an English sentence like this:</p>

<pre><code>S =&gt; NP VP | VP
NP =&gt; N | Det N | Det Adj N
VB =&gt; V | V NP
N =&gt; i you bus cake bear
V =&gt; hug love destroy am
Det =&gt; a the
Adj =&gt; pink stylish
</code></pre>

<p>I've searched for several hours and really am out of ideas. 
I found articles talking about shallow parsing, depth-first backtracking and related things, and while I'm familiar with most of them, I still can't apply them to this problem. I tagged Lisp and Haskell because those are the languages I plan to implement this in, but I don't mind if you use other languages in your replies.</p>

<p>I'd appreciate hints, good articles and everything in general.</p>
","algorithm, haskell, lisp, nlp","<p>Here's a working Haskell example. It turns out there's a few tricks to learn before you can make it work! The zeroth thing to do is boilerplate: turn off the dreaded monomorphism restriction, import some libraries, and define some functions that aren't in the libraries (but should be):</p>

<pre><code>{-# LANGUAGE NoMonomorphismRestriction #-}
import Control.Applicative ((&lt;*))
import Control.Monad
import Text.ParserCombinators.Parsec

ensure p x = guard (p x) &gt;&gt; return x
singleToken t = tokenPrim id (\pos _ _ -&gt; incSourceColumn pos 1) (ensure (==t))
anyOf xs = choice (map singleToken xs)
</code></pre>

<p>Now that the zeroth thing is done... first, we define a data type for our abstract syntax trees. We can just follow the shape of the grammar here. However, to make it more convenient, I've factored a few of the grammar's rules; in particular, the two rules</p>

<pre><code>NP =&gt; N | Det N | Det Adj N
VB =&gt; V | V NP
</code></pre>

<p>are more conveniently written this way when it comes to actually writing a parser:</p>

<pre><code>NP =&gt; N | Det (Adj | empty) N
VB =&gt; V (NP | empty)
</code></pre>

<p>Any good book on parsing will have a chapter on why this kind of factoring is a good idea. So, the AST type:</p>

<pre><code>data Sentence
    = Complex NounPhrase VerbPhrase
    | Simple VerbPhrase
data NounPhrase
    = Short Noun
    | Long Article (Maybe Adjective) Noun
data VerbPhrase
    = VerbPhrase Verb (Maybe NounPhrase)
type Noun      = String
type Verb      = String
type Article   = String
type Adjective = String
</code></pre>

<p>Then we can make our parser. This one follows the (factored) grammar even more closely! The one wrinkle here is that we always want our parser to consume an entire sentence, so we have to explicitly ask for it to do that by demanding an ""eof"" -- or end of ""file"".</p>

<pre><code>s   = (liftM2 Complex np vp &lt;|&gt; liftM Simple vp) &lt;* eof
np  = liftM Short n &lt;|&gt; liftM3 Long det (optionMaybe adj) n
vp  = liftM2 VerbPhrase v (optionMaybe np)
n   = anyOf [""i"", ""you"", ""bus"", ""cake"", ""bear""]
v   = anyOf [""hug"", ""love"", ""destroy"", ""am""]
det = anyOf [""a"", ""the""]
adj = anyOf [""pink"", ""stylish""]
</code></pre>

<p>The last piece is the tokenizer. For this simple application, we'll just tokenize based on whitespace, so the built-in <code>words</code> function works just fine. Let's try it out! Load the whole file in ghci:</p>

<pre><code>*Main&gt; parse s ""stdin"" (words ""i love the pink cake"")
Right (Complex (Short ""i"") (VerbPhrase ""love"" (Just (Long ""the"" (Just ""pink"") ""cake""))))
*Main&gt; parse s ""stdin"" (words ""i love pink cake"")
Left ""stdin"" (line 1, column 3):
unexpected ""pink""
expecting end of input
</code></pre>

<p>Here, <code>Right</code> indicates a successful parse, and <code>Left</code> indicates an error. The ""column"" number reported in the error is actually the word number where the error occurred, due to the way we're computing source positions in <code>singleToken</code>.</p>

  foreword to WordNet: An Electronic Lexical Database, pp. xviii-xix:</p>
  
  <p>People sometimes ask, ""Where did you get your words?"" We began in 1985
  with the words in KuÄera and Francis's Standard Corpus of Present-Day
  Edited English (familiarly known as the Brown Corpus), principally
  because they provided frequencies for the different parts of speech.
  We were well launched into that list when Henry KuÄera warned us that,
  although he and Francis owned the Brown Corpus, the syntactic tagging
  data had been sold to Houghton Mifflin. We therefore dropped our plan
  to use their frequency counts (in 1988 Richard Beckwith developed a
  polysemy index that we use instead). We also incorporated all the
  adjectives pairs that Charles Osgood had used to develop the semantic
  differential. And since synonyms were critically important to us, we
  looked words up in various thesauruses: for example, Laurence Urdang's
  little ""Basic Book of Synonyms and Antonyms"" (1978), Urdang's revision
  of Rodale's ""The Synonym Finder"" (1978), and Robert Chapman's 4th
  edition of ""Roget's International Thesaurus"" (1977) -- in such works,
  one word quickly leads on to others. Late in 1986 we received a list
  of words compiled by Fred Chang at the Naval Personnel Research and
  Development Center, which we compared with our own list; we were
  dismayed to find only 15% overlap.</p>
  
  <p>So Chang's list became input. And in 1993 we obtained the list of
  39,143 words that Ralph Grishman and his colleagues at New York
  University included in their common lexicon, COMLEX; this time we were
  dismayed that WordNet contained only 74% of the COMLEX words. But that
  list, too, became input. In short, a variety of sources have
  contributed; we were not well disciplined in building our vocabulary.
  The fact is that the English lexicon is very large, and we were lucky
  that our sponsors were patient with us as we slowly crawled up the
  mountain.</p>

Java query about finding a word in a sentence,"<p>I am using Stanford's NLP parser (http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml) to split a block of text into sentences and then see which sentences contain a given word. </p>

<p>Here is my code so far:</p>

<pre><code>import java.io.FileReader;
import java.io.IOException;
import java.util.List;

import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.*;
import edu.stanford.nlp.process.*;

public class TokenizerDemo {

    public static void main(String[] args) throws IOException {
        DocumentPreprocessor dp = new DocumentPreprocessor(args[0]);
        for (List sentence : dp) {
            for (Object word : sentence) {
                System.out.println(word);
                System.out.println(word.getClass().getName());
                if (word.equals(args[1])) {
                    System.out.println(""yes!\n"");
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I run the code from the command line using ""java TokenizerDemo testfile.txt wall""</p>

<p>The contents of testfile.txt is:</p>

<pre><code>Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall. Humpty Dumpty had a great fall.
</code></pre>

<p>So I want the program to detect ""wall"" in the first sentence (""wall"" entered as the second argument on the command line). But the program doesn't detect ""wall"", because it never prints ""yes!"". The output of the program is:</p>

<pre><code>Humpty
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
Dumpty
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
sat
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
on
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
a
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
wall
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
.
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
Humpty
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
Dumpty

had

a
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
great
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
fall
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
.
edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word
</code></pre>

<p>DocumentPreprocessor from the Stanford parser correctly splits the text into two sentences. The problem appears to be with the use of the equals method. Each word has type ""edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word"". I've tried accessing the underlying string of the word, so I can then check if the string equals ""wall"", but I can't figure out how to access it.  </p>

<p>If I write the second for loop as ""for (Word word : sentence) {"" then I get an incompatible types error message on complilation. </p>
","java, string, nlp, stanford-nlp, sentence","<p>The <code>String</code> content can be accessed by calling the method: <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/nlp/javadoc/javanlp/edu/stanford/nlp/ling/Word.html#word%28%29"" rel=""nofollow""><code>word()</code></a> on <code>edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word</code>; e.g.</p>

<pre><code>import edu.stanford.nlp.ling.Word;

for (Word word : words) {
  if (word.word().equals(args(1))) {
    System.err.println(""Yes!"");
  }
}

<p>Also note that it is better to use generics when defining the <code>List</code> as it means the compiler or IDE will typically warn you if you attempt to compare classes of incompatible types (e.g. <code>Word</code> versus <code>String</code>).</p>

Validating Syntax of a Sentence,"<p>I'm looking for a library to simply validate the the syntax of english natural language sentences. It doesn't have to be correct all the time (and obviously some sentences will be ambiguous/ humans will disagree on validity).</p>

<p>So for example:
jim likes the blue ball 
 would be valid, whereas
jim likes likes blue ball jim
 would not be.</p>

<p>I've tried ""Syntactic parser of English sentences"" by Andrej Pancik which appears to do what I want, but unfortunately most sentences I'd consider to be ""valid"" it doesn't consider to be.</p>

And this will likely get you the same effect as you had with Pancik's parser.

ANTLR for Writing JAPE Grammar,"<p>I am using GATE to process texts written in natural language. I have to extract height, weight, bp etc from the text and store it in structured form. Now, these things(i.e height, weight etc) can be written in many forms which is unknown to me. Writing JAPE grammar for all the different ways I can come up with, is merely hard-coding it. Do I have any other option to process the docs in a more flexible way?</p>

<p>Also, I am confused as to whether I can use ANTLR to generate jape grammar by presenting different ways of writing height, weight etc? </p>

<p>The text will contain the following:</p>

<pre><code>Vitals: Height: 72 inches, Weight is 170 pounds, T is 89.9 degree Fahrenheit. OR
Vitals: He is 184 cm tall, his weight was 67.8 Kg, RR 16 (its respiration rate). OR
Vitals: height is 6ft 3 in, he weighs 70 kg, pulse is 67, Temperature 99.8 degrees.

<p>Now I use JAPE grammar and ANNIE to tokenize the text to extract these vitals and store in structured form. Will using ANTLR be flexible to tokenize this such text? Flexible in the sense that I should not hard-code it for each way of representation, as you see height, weight etc can be represented in many forms.</p>

For every new task and every new experiment I write programs (normally in Python and sometimes Java) to extract the features and values I need and transform the data from one format to the other. This usually results in a very large number of very large files and a very large number of small programs which process them in order to get the input for some machine learning framework (like the arff files for Weka). </p>

<p>One needs to be extremely well organised to deal with that and program with great care not to miss any important peculiarities, exceptions or errors in the tons of data. Many principles of good software design like design patterns or refactoring paradigms are no big use for these tasks because things like security, maintainability or sustainability are of no real importance - once the program successfully processed the data one doesn't need it any longer. This has gone so far that I even stopped bothering about using classes or functions at all in my Python code and program in a simple procedural way. The next experiment will require different data sets with unique characteristics and in a different format so that their preparation will likely have to be programmed from scratch anyway. My experience so far is that it's not unusual to spend 80-90% of a project's time on the task of preparing training data. Hours and days go by only on thinking about how to get from one data format to another. At times, this can become quite frustrating.</p>

<p>Well, you probably guessed that I'm exaggerating a bit, on purpose even, but I'm positive you understand what I'm trying to say. My question, actually, is this:</p>

<p>Are there any general frameworks, architectures, best practices for approaching these tasks?    How much of the code I write can I expect to be reusable given optimal design?</p>
","machine-learning, nlp, code-reuse, training-data","<p>I find myself mostly using the textutils from  GNU coreutils and flex for corpus preparation, chaining things together in simple scripts, at least when the preparations i need to make are simple enough for regular expressions and trivial filtering etc.</p>

<p>It is still possible to make things reusable, the general rules also apply here. If you are programming with no regard to best practices and the like and just program procedurally there is IMHO really no wonder that you have to do everything from scratch when starting a new project. </p>

<p>Even though the format requirements will vary a lot there is still many common tasks, ie. tag-stripping, tag-translation, selection, tabulation, some trivial data harvesting such as number of tokens, sentences and the like. Programming these tasks aming for high reusability will pay off, even though it takes longer at first. </p>

Looking for a way to optimize this algorithm for parsing a very large string,"<p>The following class parses through a very large string (an entire novel of text) and breaks it into consecutive 4-character strings that are stored as a Tuple. Then each tuple can be assigned a probability based on a calculation. I am using this as part of a monte carlo/ genetic algorithm to train the program to recognize a language based on syntax only (just the character transitions). </p>

<p>I am wondering if there is a faster way of doing this. It takes about 400ms to look up the probability of any given 4-character tuple. The relevant method _Probablity() is at the end of the class. </p>

<p><b>EDIT</b> - I'm providing more details to clear things up,</p>

<p>1) Strictly speaking I've only worked with English so far, but its true that different alphabets will have to be considered. Currently I only want the program to recognize English, similar to whats described in this paper: <a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf</a></p>

<p>2) I am calculating the probabilities of n-tuples of characters where n &lt;= 4. For instance if I am calculating the total probability of the string ""that"", I would break it down into these independent tuples and calculate the probability of each individually first:</p>

<p>[t][h] </p>

<p>[t][h][a]</p>

<p>[t][h][a][t]</p>

<p>[t][h] is given the most weight, then [t][h][a], then [t][h][a][t]. Since I am not just looking at the 4-character tuple as a single unit, I wouldn't be able to just divide the instances of [t][h][a][t] in the text by the total no. of 4-tuples in the next. </p>

<p>The value assigned to each 4-tuple can't overfit to the text, because by chance many real English words may never appear in the text and they shouldn't get disproportionally low scores. Emphasing first-order character transitions (2-tuples) ameliorates this issue. Moving to the 3-tuple then the 4-tuple just refines the calculation. </p>

<p>I came up with a Dictionary that simply tallies the count of how often the tuple occurs in the text (similar to what Vilx suggested), rather than repeating identical tuples which is a waste of memory. That got me from about ~400ms per lookup to about ~40ms per, which is a pretty great improvement. I still have to look into some of the other suggestions, however. </p>
","c#, artificial-intelligence, nlp, tuples, montecarlo","<p>In yoiu probability method you are iterating the map 8 times. Each of your wheres iterates the entire list and so does the count. Adding a .ToList() ad the end would (potentially) speed things. That said I think your main problem is that the structure you've chossen to store the data in is not suited for the purpose of the probability method. You could create a one pass version where the structure you store you're data in calculates the tentative distribution on insert. That way when you're done with the insert (which shouldn't be slowed down too much) you're done or you could do as the code below have a cheap calculation of the probability when you need it.</p>

<p>As an aside you might want to take puntuation and whitespace into account. The first letter/word of a sentence and the first letter of a word gives clear indication on what language a given text is written in by taking punctuaion charaters and whitespace as part of you distribution you include those characteristics of the sample data. We did that some years back. Doing that we shown that using just three characters was almost as exact (we had no failures with three on our test data and almost as exact is an assumption given that there most be some weird text where the lack of information would yield an incorrect result). as using more (we test up till 7) but the speed of three letters made that the best case.</p>

","nlp, semantics, keyword, information-retrieval, stemming","<p>I partially agree with @larsmans comment. Your question, in practice, may indeed be more complex than the question you posted.</p>

<p>However, simplifying the question/problem, I guess the answer to your question could be one of Lucene's implementation: <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/docs/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lucene</a> (Java), <a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Lucene.Net</a> (C#) or <a href=""http://clucene.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CLucene</a> (C++).</p>

<p>Following the points in your question:</p>

<p>Lucene would take care of point 1 by using String tokenizers (you can customize or use your own).
For point 2 you could use a <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TokenFilter</a> like <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/StopFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">StopFilter</a> so Lucene can read a list of stopwords (""the"", ""a"", ""an""...) that it should not use.
For point 3 you could use <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/2_3_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/PorterStemFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">PorterStemFilter</a>.
Point 4 is a little bit trickier, but could be done using a customized <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_3/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/TokenFilter.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TokenFilter</a>.
Point 1 to 4 are perfomed in the Analysis/tokenization phase, which an <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/3_0_1/api/core/org/apache/lucene/analysis/Analyzer.html%5C"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Analyzer</a> is responsible.</p>

<p>Regarding point 5, in Lucene you can store Documents with fields. A document can have an arbitrary number and mix of fields. So you could create a single Document for each chat room with all its text concatenated, and have another field of the document reference the chatroom it was extracted from. You will end up with a bunch of Lucene documents that <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1844194/get-cosine-similarity-between-two-documents-in-lucene"">you can compare</a>. So you can compare your current chat room with others to see which one is more similar to the one you are on.</p>

<p>If all you want is a set of the best keywords to describe a chatrom your needs are closer to information extraction/automatic summarization/topic spotting task as @larsmans said. But you can <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6334692/how-to-use-a-lucene-analyzer-to-tokenize-a-string/6335057#6335057"">still use Lucene for the parsing/tokenization</a> phase.</p>

Lucene Porter Stemmer Thread Safe?,"<p>Quick question, is the porter stemmer from Lucene packages (Java) thread safe?</p>

<p>I'm guessing the answer is no as you need to set the current string, invoke stem method then get the current block to get the stemmed word. But perhaps I'm missing something - Is there are thread safe method to do stemming of a single word or string from Lucene?</p>

<p>Does anyone from experience know if it is faster to instantiate one Porter Stemmer instance and then use a synchronized block over that stemmer instance and do the <code>setCurrent(""...""); stem(); get();</code> routine or is it just faster to create a new porter stemmer instance for each string/document you want to process. </p>

<p>In this instance I have many 1000s of documents which are each taken up by a pool of threads (i.e. 1 thread has one document). </p>

<p>Edit FYI - Example usage pattern:</p>

<pre><code>import org.tartarus.snowball.ext.PorterStemmer;
...
private String stem(String word){
       PorterStemmer stem = new PorterStemmer();
       stem.setCurrent(word);
       stem.stem();
       return stem.getCurrent();

If stemming is one of the main things your program does, and it has no other way of keeping your CPU cores busy, then a synchronized block seems like a bad idea: the program would be blocking all the time, waiting for the stemmer to finish one document.

<p>Firstly, I don't know much about Arabic word forms and I just read the Wikipedia doc on it (linked above).  Thanks for giving me a reason to read up on it but forgive me if I totally mess this up :-)... </p>

Grammar production class implementation in C#,"<p>Grammar by definition contains productions, example of very simple grammar:</p>

<pre><code>E -&gt; E + E
E -&gt; n
</code></pre>

<p>I want to implement Grammar class in c#, but I'm not sure how to store productions, for example how to make difference between terminal and non-terminal symbol.
i was thinking about:</p>

<pre><code>struct Production
{
   String Left;       // for example E
   String Right;      // for example +
}
</code></pre>

<p>Left will always be non-terminal symbol (it's about context-free grammars)
But right side of production can contain terminal &amp; non-terminal symbols</p>

<p>So now I'm thinkig about 2 ways of implementation:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Non-terminal symbols will be written using brackets, for example:</p>

<p>E+E will be represented as string ""[E]+[E]""</p></li>
<li><p>Create additional data structure NonTerminal</p>

<p>struct NonTerminal
{
  String Symbol;
}</p></li>
</ol>

<p>and E+E will be represented as array/list:</p>

<pre><code>[new NonTerminal(""E""), ""+"", new NonTerminal(""E"")]
</code></pre>

<p>but think that there are better ideas, it would be helpfull to hear some response</p>
","c#, grammar, nlp, context-free-grammar","<p>I'd use </p>

<pre><code> Dictionary&lt;NonTerminalSymbol,Set&lt;List&lt;Symbol&gt;&gt;&gt; 
</code></pre>

<p>enabling lookup by Nonterminal of the <em>set</em> of production rule right-hand-sides (themselves represented as lists of Terminal/Nonterminal Symbols) associated with the Nonterminal.  (OP's question shows that the Nonterminal E might be associated with <em>two</em> rules, but we only need the right-hand sides if we have the left hand side).</p>

<p>This representation works only for a vanilla BNF grammar definitions, in which there is no syntactic sugar for common grammar-defining idioms.  Such idioms typically include <em>choice</em>, <em>Kleene star/plus</em>, ... and when they are avialable in defining the grammar you get an so-called Extended BNF or EBNF.  If we write EBNF only allowing <em>choice</em> denoted by <strong>|</strong>, the Expression grammar in flat form hinted at by OP as an example is:</p>

<pre><code>         E = S ;
         S = P | S + P | S - P ; 
         P = T | P * T | P / T ;
         T = T ** M | ( E ) | Number | ID ;
</code></pre>

<p>and my first suggestion <em>can</em> represent this, because the alternation is only used to show different rule right-hand-sides.  However, it won't represent this:</p>

<pre><code>         E = S ;
         S = P A* ;
         A = + P | - P ;
         P = T M+ ; -- to be different
         M = * T | / T ;
         T = T ** M | ( E ) | Number | ID | ID ( E  ( # | C) * ) ; -- function call with skipped parameters
         C = , E ;
</code></pre>

<p>The key problem that this additional notation introduces is the ability to compose the WBNF operators repeatedly on sub-syntax definitions, and that's the whole point of EBNF. </p>

<p>To represent EBNF, you have to store productions essentially as <em>trees</em> that represent the, well, expression structure of the EBNF (in fact, this is essentially the same problem as representing any expression grammar).</p>

<p>To represent the EBNF (expression) tree, you need to define the tree structure of the EBNF. 
You need tree nodes for:</p>

<ul>
<li>symbols (terminal or not)</li>
<li>Alternation (having a list of alternatives)</li>
<li>Kleene *</li>
<li>Kleene +</li>
<li>""Optional"" ?</li>
<li>others that you decide your EBNF has as operators (e.g., comma'd lists, a way to say that one has a list of grammar elements seperated by a chosen ""comma"" character, or ended by a chosen ""semicolon"" character, ...)</li>
</ul>

<p>The easiest way to do that is to first write an EBNF grammar for the EBNF itself:</p>

<pre><code>EBNF = RULE+ ;
RULE = LHS ""="" TERM* "";"" ;
TERM = STRING | SYMBOL | TERM ""*"" 
       | TERM ""+"" | ';' STRING TERM | "","" TERM STRING 
      ""("" TERM* "")"" ;
</code></pre>

<p>Note that I've added comma'd and semicolon'ed list to the EBNF (extended, remember?)</p>

<p>Now we can simply inspect the EBNF to decide what is needed.
What you now need is a set of records (OK, classes for C#'er) to represent each of these rules.
So:</p>

<ul>
<li>a class for EBNF that contains a set of rules</li>
<li>a class for a RULE having an LHS symbol and a LIST</li>
<li>an abstract base class for TERM with several concrete variants, one for each alternative of TERM (a so-called ""discriminated union"" typically implemented by inheritance and instance_of checks in an OO language).</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that some of the concrete variants can refer to other class types in the representation, which is how you get a tree.  For instance:</p>

<pre><code>   KleeneStar inherits_from TERM {
        T: TERM:
   }
</code></pre>

<p>Details left to the reader for encoding the rest.</p>

<p>This raises an <em>unstated</em> problem for the OP:  how do you <em>use</em> this grammmar representation to drive parsing of strings?</p>

<p>The simple answer is <em>get a parser generator</em>, which means you need to figure out what EBNF <em>it</em> uses. (In this case, it might simply be easier to store your EBNF as text and hand it to that parser generator, which kind of makes this whole discussion moot).</p>

<p>If you can't get one (?), or want to build one of your own, well, now you have the representation you need to climb over to build it.   One other alternative is to build a recursive descent parser driven by this representation to do your parsing.  The approach to do that is too large to contain in the margin of this answer, but is straightforward for those with experience with recursion.</p>

<p>EDIT 10/22:  OP clarifies that he insists on parsing <em>all context free grammars</em> and ""especially NL"".   For all context free grammars, he will need very a stong parsing engine (Earley, GLR, full backtracking, ...).   For Natural Language, he will need parsers much stronger than those; people have been trying to build such parsers for decades with only some, but definitely not easy, success.   Either of these two requirements seems to make the discussion of representing the grammar rather pointless; if he does represent a straight context free grammar, it won't parse natural language (proven by those guys trying for decades), and if he wants a more powerful NL parser, he'll need to simply use what the bleeding edge types have produced.   Count me a pessimist on his probable success, unless he decides to become a real expert in the area of NL parsing.</p>

<p>So far the main problem with this has been locating a corpus that describes events with a limited enough vocabulary to pose similar questions across all of the events (e.g. if all of the events involved chess, I could reasonably ask 'what piece moved?' and an answer could be drawn from a decent percentage of the event description sentences).  </p>

Building/Running a Streaming Weka Text Classifer in Java,"<p>We have been using the Weka Explorer GUI to build a few classifier models. Now Testing is complete we would like to implement this model within a Java application so it can take new messages.</p>

<p>So for new messages we need to tokenize the message, match up tokens in the message with tokens used to build the word vector for the model and then parse this word vector to the model. </p>

<p>How should we go about this process? Are there any examples available? </p>

<p>How do we deal with new tokens (i.e. words that appear in new text messages which are not a part of the word vector used to build the model)?</p>

<p>For the classifier preprocessing/tokenising we are using the NGram Tokenizer, Stemmer and IDF Transform. So we need to figure out how to do these steps before we can create a new instancebased on the text we would like to classify. </p>

<p>As a side When building a classifier in the explorer, under more options there is a button to choose 'output classifier code' which sounds like it outputs Java source code to build and use the model however this option is disabled. Tested with a number of different classifiers (RF, NB) and it doesnt change. I'm guessing its not implemented for these?</p>

Intelligent transliteration in PHP,"<p>I'm interested in writing a PHP script (I do welcome language-agnostic suggestions) that would transliterate a sentence or word written in English (phoenetically) into the script of another language. Since I'm looking at English written phoenetically (i.e. by ear): I'd have to deal with variant spellings of the same word.</p>

<p>Does anyone have any advice on where I could start? </p>

<p>EDIT: I'm doing this purely for educational purposes, and I was initially under the impression that in order to figure out the connection between variant spellings (which could be found in a corpus of IM messages, Facebook posts written in the romanized form of the language), you'd need some sort of machine learning tool. However, I'd like to know if I was on the right track, and I'd like some help in figuring out what next I should look into to get this working (for instance: which machine learning tool should I look into?). </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic
  decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and
  their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and
  sometimes exceeds 650 million years. The fossil fuels, which contain
  high percentages of carbon, include coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
  Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen
  ratios like methane, to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials
  composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane can be
  found in hydrocarbon fields, alone, associated with oil, or in the
  form of methane clathrates. It is generally accepted that they formed
  from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and
  pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years. This biogenic
  theory was first introduced by Georg Agricola in 1556 and later by
  Mikhail Lomonosov in the 18th century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fossil fuel reforming is a method of producing hydrogen or other
  useful products from fossil fuels such as natural gas. This is
  achieved in a processing device called a reformer which reacts steam
  at high temperature with the fossil fuel. The steam methane reformer
  is widely used in industry to make hydrogen. There is also interest in
  the development of much smaller units based on similar technology to
  produce hydrogen as a feedstock for fuel cells. Small-scale steam
  reforming units to supply fuel cells are currently the subject of
  research and development, typically involving the reforming of
  methanol or natural gas but other fuels are also being considered such
  as propane, gasoline, autogas, diesel fuel, and ethanol.</p>

Parsing Natural Language Music Citations Using Regex,"<p>I am struggling with nailing down a fairly complex regular expression to parse song titles with optional artist attribution from loosely-typed English. The user input comes from a single text field and the regex matches will be used to query a song database to get unique track IDs. I need to be able to get these matches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = song title</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = artist</li>
</ul>
<p>while being fairly liberal in allowed formats.</p>
<h2>Examples</h2>
<p>The wold &quot;by&quot; should split the string into song title and artist (but only on word boundaries); as should a comma with/without trailing whitespace:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>baby one more time by britney spears</p>
<p>baby one more time, britney spears</p>
<p>baby one more time,britney spears</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = baby one more time</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = britney spears</li>
</ul>
<p>False positives like these are acceptable:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>down by the bay</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = down</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = the bay</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = that's what i'm not</li>
</ul>
<p>â¦assuming quotes can be used to mark a run of text as a song title explicitly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;down by the bay&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = down by the bay</li>
<li><code>\2</code> not matched</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not&quot; by arctic monkeys</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = arctic monkeys</li>
</ul>
<p>Single quotes should work too, but obviously not if they appear within the title:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>'whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not'</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am, that</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = s what i'm not'</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, if quotes are in use, the word &quot;by&quot; or a comma are optional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;down by the bay&quot; raffi</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = down by the bay</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = raffi</li>
</ul>
<p>However, if there are no quotes, and more than one &quot;by&quot;, then only the last &quot;by&quot; should be used as a delimiter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>down by the bay by raffi</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = down by the bay</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = raffi</li>
</ul>
<p>Is this even possible with a single regex? Or would the more sane way be to split it up into multiple expressions? Either way, what might this look like?</p>
","regex, nlp","<p>Here is an example, using C#:</p>

<pre><code>var regex = @""^((""""(?&lt;title&gt;[^""""]+)""""|'(?&lt;title&gt;[^']+)')(\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+)?|(?&lt;title&gt;.*)(\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+))\s*(?&lt;artist&gt;.*)$"";

var items = new []{
    ""baby one more time by britney spears"",
    ""baby one more time, britney spears"",
    ""baby one more time,britney spears"",
    ""down by the bay"",
    ""whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not"",
    ""\""down by the bay\"""",
    ""\""whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not\"" by arctic monkeys"",
    ""'whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not'"",
    ""\""down by the bay\"" raffi"",
    ""down by the bay by raffi"",
};

foreach (var item in items)
{
    var match = Regex.Match(item, regex, RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture);
    Console.WriteLine(match.Groups[""title""] + "" - "" + match.Groups[""artist""]);
}
</code></pre>

<p>Output matches your specification, as far as I can tell:</p>

<pre><code>baby one more time - britney spears
baby one more time - britney spears
baby one more time - britney spears
down - the bay
whatever people say i am - that's what i'm not
down by the bay - 
whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not - arctic monkeys
whatever people say i am, that - s what i'm not'
down by the bay - raffi
down by the bay - raffi
</code></pre>

<p>You can actually make it better for the single-quote case by allowing apostrophes inside words:</p>

<pre><code>var regex = @""^((""""(?&lt;title&gt;[^""""]+)""""|'(?&lt;title&gt;([^']|(?&lt;=\w)'(?=\w))+)')(\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+)?|(?&lt;title&gt;.*)(\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+))\s*(?&lt;artist&gt;.*)$"";
</code></pre>

<p>Which fixes this case:</p>

<pre><code>whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not - 
</code></pre>

<p>Here's a commented version of the regex, which explains what each part does (should be matched with <code>RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture|RegexOptions.IgnorePatternWhitespace</code>):</p>

<pre><code>var regex = @""
^
  (
    (
      """"(?&lt;title&gt;[^""""]+)""""               (?# matches a double-quote string )
    | '(?&lt;title&gt;([^']|(?&lt;=\w)'(?=\w))+)' (?# matches a single-quote string, allowing quotes in words )
    ) (\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+)?   (?# optionally follow these by ',' or 'by' )
  | 
  (?&lt;title&gt;.*)(\s*,\s*|\s+by\s+) (?# otherwise, everything up to ',' or 'by' )
)
\s*(?&lt;artist&gt;.*) (?# everything after this is the artist name )
$"";
</code></pre>

<p><em>Edit:</em></p>

<p>I've played around a bit with the PHP code, but I can't get it to use named capturing groups properly. Here is a version using unnamed capturing groups:</p>

<pre><code>$regex = ""/^(?:(?:\""([^\""]+)\""|'((?:[^']|(?&lt;=\\w)'(?=\\w))+)')(?:\\s*,\\s*|\\s+by\\s+)?|(.*)(?:\\s*,\\s*|\\s+by\\s+))\s*(.*)\$/"";

preg_match($regex, '""down by the river""', $matches);

print_r($matches);
</code></pre>

<p>The title will be in group 1, 2, or 3, and the artist in group 4.</p>

Reconstructing now-famous 17-year-old&#39;s Markov-chain-based information-retrieval algorithm &quot;Apodora&quot;,"<p>While we were all twiddling our thumbs, a 17-year-old Canadian boy has apparently found an information retrieval algorithm that: </p>

<p>a) performs with twice the precision of the current, and widely-used vector space model</p>

<p>b) is 'fairly accurate' at identifying similar words. </p>

<p>c) makes microsearch more accurate</p>

<p>Here is a good <a href=""http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/technology/science-fair-gold-medalist-17-invents-better-way-to-search-internet/article2118962/"" rel=""noreferrer"">interview</a>.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, there's no published paper I can find yet, but, from the snatches I remember from the graphical models and machine learning classes I took a few years ago, I think we should be able to reconstruct it from his submision abstract, and what he says about it in interviews.</p>

<p>From interview:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Some searches find words that appear in similar contexts. Thatâs
  pretty good, but thatâs following the relationships to the first
  degree. My algorithm tries to follow connections further. Connections
  that are close are deemed more valuable. In theory, it follows
  connections to an infinite degree.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And the abstract puts it in context:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A novel information retrieval algorithm called ""Apodora"" is introduced,
  using limiting powers of Markov chain-like matrices to determine
  models for the documents and making contextual statistical inferences
  about the semantics of words. The system is implemented and compared
  to the vector space model. Especially when the query is short, the
  novel algorithm gives results with approximately twice the precision
  and has interesting applications to microsearch.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I feel like someone who knows about markov-chain-like matrices or information retrieval would immediately be able to realize what he's doing. </p>

<p>So: what is he doing?</p>
","nlp, machine-learning, information-retrieval, markov-chains","<p>From the use of words like 'context' and the fact that he's introduced a second order level of statistical dependency, I suspect he is doing something related to the LDA-HMM method outlined in the paper: Griffiths, T., Steyvers, M., Blei, D., &amp; Tenenbaum, J. (2005). Integrating topics and syntax. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems.  There are some inherent limits to the resolution of the search due to model averaging. However, I'm envious of doing stuff like this at 17 and I hope to heck he's done something independent and at least incrementally better.

Word Net - Word Synonyms &amp; related word constructs - Java or Python,"<p>I am looking to use WordNet to look for a collection of like terms from a base set of terms. </p>

<p>For example, the word <strong><em>'discouraged'</em></strong> - potential synonyms could be: <code>daunted, glum, deterred, pessimistic</code>. </p>

<p>I also wanted to identify potential bi-grams such as; <code>beat down, put off, caved in</code> etc.</p>

<p>How do I go about extracting this information using Java or Python? Are there any hosted WordNet databases/web interfaces which would allow such querying?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","java, python, nlp, text-mining, wordnet","<p>It is easiest to understand the WordNet data by looking 
at the Prolog files. They are documented here:</p>

<p><a href=""http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/prologdb.5WN.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://wordnet.princeton.edu/wordnet/man/prologdb.5WN.html</a></p>

<p>WordNet terms are group into synsets. A synset is a maximal 
synonym set. Synsets have a primary key so that they can be used 
in semantic relationships. </p>

<p>So answering your first question, you can list the different 
senses and corresponding synonyms of a word as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Input X: Term
Output Y: Sense  
Output L: Synonyms in this Sense  

s_helper(X,Y) :- s(X,_,Y,_,_,_).  
?- setof(H,(s_helper(Y,X),s_helper(Y,H)),L).  
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>?- setof(H,(s_helper(Y,'discouraged'),s_helper(Y,H),L).  
Y = 301664880,  
L = [demoralised, demoralized, discouraged, disheartened] ;  
Y = 301992418,  
L = [discouraged] ;  
No  
</code></pre>

<p>For the second part of your question, WordNet terms are 
sequences of words. So you can search this WordNet terms 
for words as follows:</p>

<pre><code>Input X: Word  
Output Y: Term

s_helper(X) :- s(_,_,X,_,_,_).  
word_in_term(X,Y) :- atom_concat(X,' ',H), sub_atom(Y,0,_,_,H).
word_in_term(X,Y) :- atom_concat(' ',X,H), atom_concat(H,' ',J), sub_atom(Y,_,_,_,J).
word_in_term(X,Y) :- atom_concat(' ',X,H), sub_atom(Y,_,_,0,H).
?- s_helper(Y), word_in_term(X,Y).
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>?- s_helper(X), word_in_term('beat',X).  
X = 'beat generation' ;  
X = 'beat in' ;  
X = 'beat about' ;  
X = 'beat around the bush' ;  
X = 'beat out' ;  
X = 'beat up' ;  
X = 'beat up' ;  
X = 'beat back' ;  
X = 'beat out' ;  
X = 'beat down' ;  
X = 'beat a retreat' ;  
X = 'beat down' ;  
X = 'beat down' ;  
No
</code></pre>

<p>This would give you potential n-grams, but no so much
morphological variation. WordNet does also exhibit some
lexical relations, which could be useful. </p>

<p>But both Prolog queries I have given are not very efficient.
The problem is the lack of some word indexing. A Java
implementation could of course implement something better.
Just imagine something along:</p>

<pre><code>class Synset {  
    static Hashtable&lt;Integer,Synset&gt; synset_access;  
    static Hashtable&lt;String,Vector&lt;Synset&gt;&gt; term_access;  
}
</code></pre>

<p>Some Prolog can do the same, by a indexing directive, it is
possible to instruct the Prolog system to index on multiple
arguments for a predicate.</p>

<p>Putting up a web service shouldn't be that difficult, either
in Java or Prolog. Many Prologs systems easily allow embedding

Find an efficient way to integrate different language libraries into one project using Python as the &quot;glue&quot;,"<p>I am about to get involved in a NLP-related project and I need to use various libraries. Some are in java, others in C/C++ (for tasks that require more speed) and finally some are in Python. I was thinking of using Python as the ""glue"" and create wrapper-classes for every task that I want to do that relies on a different language. In order to do that, the wrapper class, for example, would execute the java program and communicate with it using pipes. 
My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Do you think that would work for cpu-demanding and highly repetitive tasks? Or would the overhead added by the pipe-communication be too heavy?</p></li>
<li><p>Is there any other (preferably simple) architecture that you would suggest?</p></li>

Using Markov models to convert all-caps to mixed-case and related problems,"<p>I've been thinking about using Markov techniques to restore missing information to natural language text.</p>

<ul>
<li>Restore all-caps text to mixed-case.</li>
<li>Restore accents / diacritics to languages which should have them but have been converted to plain ASCII.</li>
<li>Convert rough phonetic transcriptions back into native alphabets.</li>
</ul>

How to correct the user input (Kind of google &quot;did you mean?&quot;),"<p>I have the following requirement: -</p>

<p>I have many (say 1 million) values (names).
The user will type a search string.</p>

<p>I don't expect the user to spell the names correctly.</p>

<p>So, I want to make kind of Google ""Did you mean"". This will list all the possible values from my datastore. There is a similar but not same question <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/135777/a-stringtoken-parser-which-gives-google-search-style-did-you-mean-suggestions"">here</a>. This did not answer my question.</p>

<p>My question: -
1) I think it is not advisable to store those data in RDBMS. Because then I won't have filter on the SQL queries. And I have to do full table scan. So, in <strong>this situation how the data should be stored?</strong></p>

<p>2) The second question is the same as <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/135777/a-stringtoken-parser-which-gives-google-search-style-did-you-mean-suggestions"">this</a>. But, just for the completeness of my question: how do I search through the large data set?
Suppose, there is a name Franky in the dataset. 
If a user types as Phranky, how do I match the Franky? Do I have to loop through all the names?</p>

<p>I came across <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Levenshtein Distance</a>, which will be a good technique to find the possible strings. But again, my question is do I have to operate on all 1 million values from my data store?</p>

<p>3) I know, Google does it by watching users behavior. But I want to do it without watching user behavior, i.e. by using, I don't know yet, say distance algorithms. Because the former method will require large volume of searches to start with!</p>

<p>4) As <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/users/146077/kirk-broadhurst"">Kirk Broadhurst</a> pointed out in an answer <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1284782/how-to-correct-the-user-input-kind-of-google-did-you-mean/1360275#1360275"">below</a>, there are two possible scenarios: -</p>

<ul>
<li>Users mistyping a word (an edit
distance algorithm)</li>
<li>Users not knowing a word and guessing
(a phonetic match algorithm)</li>
</ul>

<p>I am interested in both of these. They are really two separate things; e.g. Sean and Shawn sound the same but have an edit distance of 3 - too high to be considered a typo.</p>

<p>-- edit --</p>

<p>I tried training the classifier and got good results: F1 score was 0.94 without head mark and 0.93 with it. I think it is OK. The problem is that the OpenNLP chunker API does not support this mark and gets confused while creating the spans. I changed the OpenNLP code to handle it and I was wondering if it is a good patch, but since it is not common I should not send the patch.</p>
","nlp, opennlp","<p>I've never seen a chunker that supports head-finding, so I can't help you with a corpus. What you might do, if you already have a chunker, is formulate a bunch of rules that designate the head after the chunker has found it, or train a classifier to do so. You can train it on your corpus and apply it on chunker output.</p>

For example, this is OK (""raggedness"" is 3 characters).</p>

<p>This is not OK (""raggedness"" is more than 6 characters)</p>

Which classifier to choose in NLTK,"<p>I want to classify text messages into several categories like, ""relation building"", ""coordination"", ""information sharing"", ""knowledge sharing"" &amp; ""conflict resolution"".

<p>I am planning to use Naive Bayes Classification, is it advisable? </p>
","nlp, classification, nltk","<p>Naive Bayes is the simplest and easy to understand classifier and for that reason it's nice to use. Decision Trees with a beam search to find the best classification are not significantly harder to understand and are usually a bit better. MaxEnt and SVM tend be more complex, and SVM requires some tuning to get right.</p>

<p>Most important is the choice of features + the amount/quality of data you provide!</p>

<p>With your problem, I would focus first on ensuring you have a good training/testing dataset and also choose good features. Since you are asking this question you haven't had much experience with machine learning for NLP, so I'd say start of easy with Naive Bayes as it doesn't use complex features- you can just tokenize and count word occurrences.</p>

Speeding up OpenNLP&#39;s POSTagging when using it for several texts,"<p>I'm currently working on a keyphrase extraction tool, which should provide tag suggestions for texts or documents on a website. As I am following the method proposed in this paper: <a href=""http://www.ijcsi.org/papers/7-2-3-16-25.pdf"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""Sarkar et al."">A New Approach to Keyphrase Extraction Using Neural Networks</a> I am using the OpenNLP toolkit's POSTagger for the first step, i.e. candidate selection. </p>

<p>In general the keyphrase extraction works pretty well. My problem is that I have to perform this expensive loading of the models from their corresponding files every time I want to use the POSTagger: </p>

<pre><code>posTagger = new POSTaggerME(new POSModel(new FileInputStream(new File(modelDir + ""/en-pos-maxent.bin""))));
tokenizer = new TokenizerME(new TokenizerModel(new FileInputStream(new File(modelDir + ""/en-token.bin""))));
// ...
String[] tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text);
String[] tags = posTagger.tag(tokens);
</code></pre>

<p>This is due to the fact that this code is not on the scope of the webserver itself but inside a ""handler"" with a lifecycle including only handling one specific request. My question is: <strong>How can I achieve loading the files only once?</strong> (I don't want to spend 10 seconds on waiting for the models to load and using it just for 200ms afterwards.)</p>

<p>My first idea was to serialize the <strong>POSTaggerME</strong> (<strong>TokenizerME</strong> resp.) and deserialize it every time I need it using Java's built-in mechanism. Unfortunately this doesn't work â it raises an exception. (I do serialize the classifier from the WEKA-toolkit which classifies my candidates at the end in order to not having to build (or train) the classifier every time. Therefore I thougth this may be applicable to the POSTaggeME as well. Unfortunately this is not the case.) </p>

<p>In the case of the Tokenizer I could refer to a simple <strong>WhitespaceTokenizer</strong> which is an inferior solution but not that bad at all:</p>

<pre><code>tokenizer = WhitespaceTokenizer.INSTANCE;

<p>So, I guess something that looks like <code>ae1.111</code> must appear in the corpus file, but nothing like <code>ae0.842</code>. That's kind of weird, but that's the reasoning for giving the <code>-NONE-</code> tag. </p>

Using Markov chains (or something similar) to produce an IRC-bot,"<p>I tried google and found little that I could understand.</p>

<p>I understand <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_chain"" rel=""noreferrer"">Markov chains</a> to a very basic level: It's a mathematical model that only depends on previous input to change states..so sort of a FSM with weighted random chances instead of different criteria?</p>

<p>I've heard that you can use them to generate semi-intelligent nonsense, given sentences of existing words to use as a dictionary of kinds. </p>

<p>I can't think of search terms to find this, so can anyone link me or explain how I could produce something that gives a semi-intelligent answer? (if you asked it about pie, it would not start going on about the vietnam war it had heard about)</p>

<p>I plan on:</p>

<ul>
<li>Having this bot idle in IRC channels for a bit</li>
<li>Strip any usernames out of the string and store as sentences or whatever</li>
<li>Over time, use this as the basis for the above.</li>
</ul>
","artificial-intelligence, nlp, markov-chains","<p>Yes, a Markov chain is a finite-state machine with probabilistic state transitions. To generate random text with a simple, first-order Markov chain:</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect bigram (adjacent word pair) statistics from a corpus (collection of text).</li>
<li>Make a markov chain with one state per word. Reserve a special state for end-of-text.</li>
<li>The probability of jumping from state/word <em>x</em> to <em>y</em> is the probability of the words <em>y</em> immediately following <em>x</em>, estimated from relative bigram frequencies in the training corpus.</li>
<li>Start with a random word <em>x</em> (perhaps determined by how often that word occurs as the first word of a sentence in the corpus). Then pick a state/word <em>y</em> to jump to randomly, taking into account the probability of <em>y</em> following <em>x</em> (the state transition probability). Repeat until you hit end-of-text.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you want to get something semi-intelligent out of this, then your best shot is to train it on lots of carefully collected texts. The ""lots"" part makes it produce proper sentences (or plausible IRC speak) with high probability; the ""carefully collected"" part means you control what it talks about. Introducing higher-order Markov chains also helps in both areas, but takes more storage to store the necessary statistics. You may also look into things like statistical smoothing.</p>

<p>However, having your IRC bot actually respond to what is said to it takes a <em>lot</em> more than Markov chains. It may be done by doing <a href=""https://secure.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/wiki/Document_classification"" rel=""noreferrer"">text categorization</a> (aka topic spotting) on what is said, then picking a domain-specific Markov chain for text generation.

<p>If you are looking for a quick comparison of key terms, <code>nltk</code> standard functions might suffice. </p>

<p>With <code>nltk</code> you can pull synonyms of your terms by looking up the <strong>synsets</strong> contained by <strong>WordNet</strong></p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; from nltk.corpus import wordnet

&gt;&gt;&gt; wordnet.synsets('donation')
[Synset('contribution.n.02'), Synset('contribution.n.03')]

&gt;&gt;&gt; wordnet.synsets('donations')
[Synset('contribution.n.02'), Synset('contribution.n.03')]
</code></pre>

<p>It understands plurals and it also tells you which part of speech the synonym corresponds to</p>

<p><strong>Synsets</strong> are stored in a tree with more specific terms at the leaves and more general ones at the root. The root terms are called <strong>hypernyms</strong></p>

<p>You can measure similarity by how close the terms are to the common <strong>hypernym</strong></p>

<p><em>Watch out for different parts of speech, according to the NLTK cookbook they don't have overlapping paths, so you shouldn't try to measure similarity between them.</em></p>

<p>Say, you have two terms <em>donation</em> and <em>gift</em>, you can get them from <code>synsets</code> but in this example I initialized them directly:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; d = wordnet.synset('donation.n.01')
&gt;&gt;&gt; g = wordnet.synset('gift.n.01')

Extracting keywords from an article,"<p>I have articles and keywords stored inside MySQL.

This will then be used on the front-end by highlighting keywords within the article and will link users to articles with the same matching keywords.</p>

<p>My concern here is how to do this processing efficiently. My idea is: when processing new articles, it finds the ngrams of the text (up to 3- or 4-gram) and then search each against the keywords table in the MySQL database. This may end up being a slow mess, I haven't tried. But maybe I'm approaching this the wrong way?</p>

<p>If it does contain the word, I'll index it.  Has worked pretty well for me without having to use other frameworks.  I don't know how hashtables work in PHP.  You'd have to google that.  I think their normal arrays work like hashtables?</p>

<p>The key to using a hashtable is that the keys are indexed for fast searching -- I think they use bTrees, but someone may correct me on that.  If you're not familiar with the btree concept, you might want to look that up.</p>

&lt;p&gt;With DryerBro you put your iPhone or iTouch on your laundry machine and it texts you and the remaining members of your laundry party when your laundryâs done. Iâm thinking this is going to be HUGE. I mean Facebook took off at colleges right?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once set up, DryerBro uses an accelerometer and Twilio to send a SMS, email or call to multiple phones when your unmentionables are ready to be picked up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Says creator Eric Kerr, âWe live in a house with 11 dudes, and weâre seriously unorganized about laundry. We all want to use the machine on the weekends, but no one ever knows when the last load was done. It bothered me as hackers that we had the tools (accelerometer, Twilio) to solve the problem, but didnât do anything about it.â&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So they built DryerBro. âWe originally looked to see if an app already used the accelerometer to detect when your laundry is done but we couldnât find anything â itâs a blue ocean strategy,â he says.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Kerr and company are completely ridiculous, but their thing apparently works. When asked about future plans for DryerBro he told TechCrunch:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;âUltimately we want to build out a hyper-local group buying ad platform for laundry detergents. Rough back of the napkin calculations indicate that weâd need roughly $41 million in financing, so weâre asking friends and family to help pony up the dough. We also want to build out the map of every active dryer in the world to hang on the wall of our office.â&lt;/p&gt;

How to use wordnet to find semantic relation between two web pages?,"<p>I want some way to determine whether two web pages are semantically related.I googled and found something called as the WordNet (a large lexical database). I want to know that how can I accomplish this using python and WordNet? </p>
","python, nlp, wordnet","<p>The easiest and crudest way to do this would be:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>extract top N terms (keywords) from each page (could be as simple as top N terms by frequency, excluding stop words such as 'a, the, an' in English). This will give you a feature set for each page.</p></li>
<li><p>Compare top terms between pages for overlaps. You could use Wordnet to compare synonyms of your terms e.g. sneakers &lt;==> trainers. If you have some degree of keyword overlap then pages are in some way related.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>A better way to derive a feature set of keywords for each page would be to extract statistically significant words for each page. You can do this by acquiring or compiling a list of (1 2 and 3 word)  <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram"" rel=""nofollow"">n-grams</a> from a reference text e.g. wikipedia) and then computing the n-grams for the words/phrases on your page and comparing the frequency of occurrence of your n-grams with that of those in  the global n-gram set. If you find you have n-grams on your page that occur more frequently than what you would expect given the reference corpus then they are likley to be statistically significant for that page. </p>

<p>The hard part in this is acquiring or compiling  the reference n-gram (it needs to be big enough to be statistically viable) which you ned to compare with the n-grams on your webpages. You can acquire google's n-gram corpus, or possibly build your own by looking at freely available to download websites like wikipedia. Others may have published a freely available n-gram set if you look around on google.</p>

","nlp, machine-learning, svm, document-classification","<p>Creating features for text classification can be as complex as you want it to be.</p>

<p>A simple approach is to just map each distinct term to a feature index.  You then represent each document as a vector of the frequencies of each term.  (You can remove stop words, weight terms etc etc).  For text classification you would also assign each vector with the label.</p>

<p>For example, if the document was the sentence:</p>

<pre><code>John loves Mary

<p>with a label ""spam"".</p>

<p>Then you might have the following mapping:</p>

loves: 2
Mary: 3

"Redefining &quot;sentence&quot; in Emacs? (single space between sentences, but ignoring abbreviations)","<p>I would like to be able to navigate by sentence in Emacs (M-a, M-e). Here's the problem: by default, Emacs expects that each sentence is separated by two spaces, and I'm used to just putting a single space. Of course, that setting can be turned off, to allow for sentences separated by only a single space, like so:</p>



<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(setq sentence-end-double-space nil)   
</code></pre>

<p>But then Emacs thinks that a sentence has ended after abbreviations with a full stop ("".""), e.g. after something like ""...a weird command, e.g. foo..."".</p>

<p>So rather than using the above code, is there a way to define the      sentence-end variable so that it counts [.!?] as marking the end of the sentence, iff what follows is one or more spaces followed by a capital letter [A-Z]?</p>

<p>And...to also allow [.!?] to mark the end of a sentence, if followed by zero or more spaces followed by a ""\""? [The reason for this latter condition is for writing LaTeX code: where a sentence is followed by a LaTeX command like \footnote{}, e.g. ""...and so we can see that the point is proved.\footnote{In some alternate world, at least.}""] </p>

<p>I tried playing around with the definition of sentence-end, and came up with:</p>



<pre class=""lang-lisp prettyprint-override""><code>(setq sentence-end ""[.!?][]'\"")}]*\\(\\$\\|[ ]+[A-Z]\\|[ ]+[A-Z]\\| \\)[

<p>Any suggestions? </p>
","regex, emacs, nlp, typography, punctuation","<p>I don't think sentence-end will do what you need it to do. You really need look-ahead regexps for this, and Emacs doesn't support them. </p>

<p>You can roll your own function to do what you need though. I don't understand all of your requirements, but the following is a start:</p>

<pre><code>(defun my-next-sentence ()
""Move point forward to the next sentence.
Start by moving to the next period, question mark or exclamation.
If this punctuation is followed by one or more whitespace
characters followed by a capital letter, or a '\', stop there. If

next potential sentence end""

  (re-search-forward ""[.?!]"")
  (if (looking-at ""[    \n]+[A-Z]\\|\\\\"")
      nil

(defun my-last-sentence ()
  (interactive)
  (re-search-backward ""[.?!][   \n]+[A-Z]\\|\\.\\\\"" nil t)
  (forward-char))
</code></pre>

<p>Most of your tweaking will need to focus on the looking-at regexp, to make sure it hits all the potential end-of-sentence conditions you need. It would be relatively easy to modify it to move the cursor to particular locations based on what it finds: Leave it be if it's a normal sentence, move past the next { if you're at a latex command, or whatever suits you.</p>

<p>Once you've got that working, can bind the functions to a M-a and M-e, probably using mode-hooks unless you want to use them for every mode.</p>

<p>The <code>hl</code> parameter is something that Google has figured out and they probably know what they're doing so that seems like a sensible third choice.</p>

<p>Then we have the HTTP headers or a final default so check the accept language header next. And finally, have a default language in place just in case all else fails.</p>

<p>However, this doesn't seem very robust. It would be easy to mess up. Probably someone has better ideas. Thus the question:</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best data format for making a book translation with a text editor?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: added tag <code>vim</code>, since I'd prefer to do this with vim and believe that some vim guru might have ideas.</p>

<p>EDIT2: started a bounty on this. I'm currently leaning to the second idea I describe, but I hope to get something about as easy to edit (and quite easy to implement) but more robust.</p>
","vim, nlp, translation, file-format","<p>One thought: if you keep each translatable chunk (one or more sentences) in its own line, vim's option <code>scrollbind</code>, <code>cursorbind</code> and a simple vertical split would help you keeping the chunks ""synchronized"". It looks very much like to what vimdiff does by default. The files should then have the same amount of lines and you don't even need to switch windows!</p>

<p>But, this isn't quite perfect because wrapped lines tend to mess up a little bit. If your translation wraps over two or three more virtual lines than the original text, the visual correlation fades as the lines aren't one-on-one anymore. I couldn't find a solution or a script for fixing that behavior. </p>

<p>Other suggestion I would propose is to interlace the translation into the original. This approaches the diff method of Benoit's suggestion. After the original is split up into chunks (one chunk per line), I would prepend a <code>&gt;&gt;</code> or similar on every line. A translation of one chunk would begin by <code>o</code>. The file would look like this:</p>

<pre><code>  &gt;&gt; This is an example sentence.
  TÃ¤mÃ¤ on esimerkkilause.
  &gt;&gt; In this format editing is easy.
  TÃ¤ssÃ¤ muodossa muokkaaminen on helppoa.
</code></pre>

<p>And I would enhance the readability by doing a <code>:match Comment /^&gt;&gt;.*$/</code> or similar, whatever looks nice with your colorscheme. Probably it would be worthwhile to write a <code>:syn</code> region that disables spell checking for the original text. Finally, as a detail, I'd bind <code>&lt;C-j&gt;</code> to do <code>2j</code> and <code>&lt;C-k&gt;</code> to <code>2k</code> to allow easy jumping between the parts that matter.</p>

<p>Pros for this latter approach also include that you could wrap things in 80 columns if you feel like I do :) It would still be trivial to write <code>&lt;C-j/k&gt;</code> to jump between translations.</p>

<p>Cons: buffer-completion suffers as now it completes both original and translated words. English words don't hopefully occur in the translations that often! :) But this is as robust as it gets. A simple <code>grep</code> will peel the original text off after you are done.</p>

Where can I download tagged word dictionary and rule?,"<p>I am learning to tag part of speech by applying transformational rules. The first step is to tag the possible POS to each word in a text by using a dictionary like:</p>

<pre><code>communicative JJ
communicator NN
communicators NNS
communion NN
communique NN
communiques NNS
communism NN
</code></pre>

<p>The second step is to apply transformational rules to change tags. I have only a very small dictionary containing the above word/tag pairs. Where can I find a large one and where can I find transformational rules? It is said tagging based on transformation may have a lot of rules. Where can I find the rules?</p>

Simple language identification using LINQ,"<p>I'm experimenting with LINQ for the first time and decided to try basic human language identification. The input text gets tested against <code>HashSet</code>s of the most common 10,000 words in the language and receives a score.</p>

this is all Linq to Objects, which

<li><p>Removed a few <code>ToList()</code> - also
unnecessary and avoids eager loading
of results when not needed.</p></li>
<li><p>While its nice having just one LINQ
query <strong>it's not a competition</strong> - aim
for readability overall and think about how
you (and others) have to maintain the code. I split up your query into three more readable (imo) parts.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Avoid side effects</strong> by all means
possible - I removed the one you had
to the variable <code>total</code> - it's
confusing - LINQ queries shouldn't
have side effects, because running the same query twice might yield different results. In your case you can just calculate the total in a separate Linq query.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Don't re-new or re-calculate variables inside a Linq
projection if not necessary</strong> - I
removed the regex from the Linq
query and initialized the variable
once outside - otherwise you are
re-newing the Regex instance <code>N</code> times
instead of just once. This might have huge performance implications depending on the query.</p></li>

<p>What I want to do is similar to word clouds built from a url or rss feed that you find on the web, except I don't want the visualization.  They are used all the time for analyzing the presidential candidate speeches to see what the theme or most used words are.  </p>

<p>The complication, is that I need to do this on thousands of short documents, and then collections or categories of these documents.  </p>

<p>My initial plan was to parse the document out, then filter common words - of, the, he, she, etc..  Then count the number of times the remaining words show up in the text (and overall collection/category).  </p>

<p>The problem is that in the future, I would like to handle stemming, plural forms, etc..   I would also like to see if there is a way to identify important phrases. (Instead of a count of a word, the count of a phrase being 2-3 words together)</p>

<p>Any guidance on a strategy, libraries or algorithms that would help are appreciated.  </p>

To calculate clusters they use some linear algebra and find principal components in that terms space. Then this components are used to form clusters and labels for them.</p>

<p>In yuor case it's worth considering reviews as documents, cluster them and get labels for clusters. May be labels would somehow evaluate reviews.</p>

<p>I have taken a course in Artificial Intelligence where NLP was introduced and fundamental sub-topics like <em>POS tagging(Transformation Based Learning), word prediction using N-grams, Hidden Markov Models, Viterbi Algorithm, Natural Language Parsing, Context Free Grammar, CKY Algorithm</em> were covered.</p>

<p>I understand this is a slightly vague question and the choice would depend primarily on my interests, but would appreciate guidance on which area would be better in terms of the research scope, practical application, industry opportunities etc. </p>

<p>EDIT: Application of skills/experience acquired while working on the project, outside NLP would also be a factor in the decision.</p>
","artificial-intelligence, nlp, machine-learning","<p>Let's first group the four options as first three in one category-NL-Text and another fourth in other-NL-Speech, as the skill set and inclination needed to pursue those are slightly different.
So first use the criteria of do you like working in the first group or second. Once you are done with that and you choose Speech. you are done. 
But if you are on other side, now there are two categories MT and remaining MA and IL Parsing. Building a MT will focus on using the ready made components and adapt them to you language pair. If you are supposed to do it statistically, it's little more on data side and you don't gain much, I mean learn/work much as in other two.If that is rule based, there are very few making it big- but you will learn a lot. Building an IL parser is a good option and might be useful for future task where will have lot of data in IL and then text processing industry will flourish. So considering future scope in industry consider my +1. Same case is with Morphological Analysis. </p>

memory usage of a probabilistic parser,"<p>I am writing a CKY parser for a Range Concatenation Grammar. I want to use a treebank as grammar, so the grammar will be large. I've written a prototype <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/download"" rel=""nofollow"">1</a> in Python and it seems to work well when I simulate a treebank of a couple tens of sentences, but the memory usage is unacceptable. I tried writing it in C++ but so far that has been very frustrating as I have never used C++ before. Here's some data (n is number of sentences the grammar is based on):</p>

<pre><code>n    mem
9    173M
18   486M
36   836M
</code></pre>

<p>This growth pattern is what is to be expected given the best-first algorithm, but the amount of overhead is what concerns me. The memory usage according to heapy is a factor ten smaller than these numbers, valgrind reported something similar. What causes this discrepancy and is there anything I can do about it in Python (or Cython)? Perhaps it's due to fragmentation? Or maybe it is the overhead of python dictionaries?</p>

<p>Some background: the two important datastructures are the agenda mapping edges to probabilities, and the chart, which is a dictionary mapping nonterminals and positions to edges. The agenda is implemented with a heapdict (which internally uses a dict and a heapq list), the chart with a dictionary mapping nonterminals and positions to edges. The agenda is frequently inserted and removed from, the chart only gets insertions and lookups. I represent edges with tuples like this:</p>

<pre><code>((""S"", 111), (""NP"", 010), (""VP"", 100, 001))
</code></pre>

<p>The strings are the nonterminal labels from the grammar, the positions are encoded as a bitmask. There can be multiple positions when a constituent is discontinuous. So this edge could be represent an analysis of ""is Mary happy"", where ""is"" and happy"" both belong to the VP. The chart dictionary is indexed by the first element of this edge, (""S"", 111) in this case. In a new version I tried transposing this representation in the hope that it would save memory due to reuse:</p>

<pre><code>((""S"", ""NP"", ""VP), (111, 100, 011))
</code></pre>

<p>I figured that Python would store the first part only once if it would occur in combination  with different positions, although I'm not actually sure this is true. In either case, it didn't seem to make any difference.</p>

<p>So basically what I am wondering is if it is worth pursuing my Python implementation any further, including doing things with Cython and different datastructures, or that writing it from the ground up in C++ is the only viable option.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE</strong>: After some improvements I no longer have issues with memory usage. I'm working on an optimized Cython version.

<p>Is there hope? Does it mean that it has ran out of memory? It uses about 15 GB before it crashes. The machine I'm using has 32 GB of RAM, plus swap as well. It crashes before outputting a single parse tree; I think it crashes after reading the grammar, during an attempt to construct a chart parse for the first sentence.</p>

<p>The parser is an efficient CYK chart parser using bit vector representations; I presume it is already pretty memory efficient. If it really requires too much memory I could sample from the grammar rules, but this will decrease parse accuracy of course.</p>

<p>Fair enough. It uses Statistical Machine Learning on data collected from billions of users to do this.

<p>Now this is the more interesting part. How does Google determine this? Have a dictionary handy and guess the most probably words again using user input? And how does it differentiate between a misspelled word and a sentence? </p>

<p>Now considering that most programmers do not have access to input from billions of users, I am looking for the best approximate way to implement this algorithm and what resources are available (datasets, libraries etc.). Any suggestions?</p>
","algorithm, language-agnostic, nlp, machine-learning","<p>Assuming you have a dictionary of words (all the words that appear in the dictionary in the worst case, all the phrases that appear in the data in your system in the best case) and that you know the relative frequency of the various words, you should be able to reasonably guess at what the user meant via some combination of the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jaro%E2%80%93Winkler_distance"" rel=""noreferrer"">similarity of the word</a> and the number of hits for the similar word.  The weights obviously require a bit of trial and error, but generally the user will be more interested in a popular result that is a bit linguistically further away from the string they entered than in a valid word that is linguistically closer but only has one or two hits in your system.</p>

<p>The second case should be a bit more straightforward.  You find all the valid words that begin the string (""T"" is invalid, ""Tr"" is invalid, ""Try"" is a word, ""Tryt"" is not a word, etc.) and for each valid word, you repeat the algorithm for the remaining string.  This should be pretty quick assuming your dictionary is indexed.  If you find a result where you are able to decompose the long string into a set of valid words with no remaining characters, that's what you recommend.  Of course, if you're Google, you probably modify the algorithm to look for substrings that are reasonably close typos to actual words and you have some logic to handle cases where a string can be read multiple ways with a loose enough spellcheck (possibly using the number of results to break the tie).</p>

emacs M-e doesn&#39;t work properly in tex-mode,"<p>I'm using emacs and auctex to write LaTeX documents. For some reason, M-e doesn't move to the end of the sentence in tex-mode as it did when I went through the tutorial. It moves to the end of the paragraph.

NLP programming tools using PHP?,"<p>Since big web applications came into existence, searching for data (and doing it lightning fast and accurate) has been one of the most important problems in web applications. For a while, I've worked using <a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/lucene.net/"">Lucene.NET</a>, which is a C# port of the <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/java/"">Lucene project</a>. </p>

<p>I also work using PHP using <a href=""http://framework.zend.com/manual/en/zend.search.lucene.html"">Zend Framework's Lucene API</a>, which brings me to my question. Most times for providing good indexing we need to perform some NLP tools like <strong>tokenizing</strong>, <strong>lemmatizing</strong>, and many more, the question is:</p>

<p>Do you know of any good NLP programming framework/toolset using PHP?</p>

<p>PS: I'm very aware of the Zend API for Lucene, but indexing data properly is not just storing and relying in Lucene, you need to perform some extra tasks, like those above.</p>
","php, lucene, nlp","<p>I would suggest that you look at <a href=""http://lucene.apache.org/solr"" rel=""noreferrer"">Solr</a>, which is a best practice implementation of Lucene. Solr uses a REST based API that also has a very good <a href=""http://code.google.com/p/solr-php-client/"" rel=""noreferrer"">PHP client</a>. This will allow you to leverage the power of Lucene without needing to perform any of the low level programming to get the NLP power that you want. Also, you would probably want to grab the trunk version of Solr as the NLP development is very active right now and new capabilities are being added every day.</p>

<p>I need to calculate the tagging accuracy(<strong>Tag wise- Recall &amp; Precision</strong>), therefore need to find an error(if any) in tagging for each word-tag pair. </p>

<p>The approach I am thinking of is to loop through these 2 text files and store them in a list and later compare the 'two' lists element by element. </p>

<p>The approach seems really crude to me, so would like you guys to suggest some better solution to the above problem.</p>

<p>From the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"" rel=""noreferrer"">wikipedia</a> page:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a classification task, the
  <strong>precision</strong> for a class is the number of
  true positives (i.e. the number of
  items correctly labeled as belonging
  to the positive class) divided by the
  total number of elements labeled as
  belonging to the positive class (i.e.
  the sum of true positives and false
  positives, which are items incorrectly
  labeled as belonging to the class).
  <strong>Recall</strong> in this context is defined as
  the number of true positives divided
  by the total number of elements that
  actually belong to the positive class
  (i.e. the sum of true positives and
  false negatives, which are items which
  were not labeled as belonging to the
  positive class but should have been).</p>
</blockquote>
","python, shell, nlp, machine-learning, text-processing","<p>Note that since every word has exactly one tag, overall recall and precision scores are meaningless for this task (they'll both just equal the accuracy measure). But it does make sense to ask for recall and precision measures per tag - for example, you could find the recall and precision for the DT tag.</p>

<p>The most efficient way to do this for all tags at once is similar to the way you suggested, though you can save one pass over the data by skipping the list-making stage. Read in a line of each file, compare the two lines word by word, and repeat until you reach the end of the files. For each word comparison, you probably want to check the words are equal for sanity, rather than assuming the two files are in sync. For each kind of tag, you keep three running totals: true positives, false positives and false negatives. If the two tags for the current word match, increment the true positive total for the tag. If they don't match, you need to increment the false negative total for the true tag and the false positive total for the tag your machine mistakenly chose. At the end, you can calculate recall and precision scores for each tag by following the formula in your Wikipedia excerpt.</p>

<p>I haven't tested this code and my Python's a but rusty, but this should give you the idea. I'm assuming the files are open and the <code>totals</code> data structure is a dictionary of dictionaries:</p>

<pre><code>finished = false
while not finished:
    trueLine = testFile.readline()
    if not trueLine: # end of file
        finished = true
    else:
        trueLine = trueLine.split() # tokenise by whitespace
        taggedLine = taggedFile.readline()
        if not taggedLine:
            print 'Error: files are out of sync.'
        taggedLine = taggedLine.split()
        if len(trueLine) != len(taggedLine):
            print 'Error: files are out of sync.'
        for i in range(len(trueLine)):
            truePair = trueLine[i].split('/')
            taggedPair = taggedLine[i].split('/')
            if truePair[0] != taggedPair[0]: # the words should match
                print 'Error: files are out of sync.'
            trueTag = truePair[1]
            guessedTag = taggedPair[1]
            if trueTag == guessedTag:
                totals[trueTag]['truePositives'] += 1
            else:
                totals[trueTag]['falseNegatives'] += 1
                totals[guessedTag]['falsePositives'] += 1

Platform is Java. For example if the user query is ""What is the height of mount Everest"" and we have a paragraph as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In 1856, the Great Trigonometric Survey of British India established the first published height of Everest, then known as Peak XV, at 29,002 ft (8,840 m). In 1865, Everest was given its official English name by the Royal Geographical Society upon recommendation of Andrew Waugh, the British Surveyor General of India at the time, who named it after his predecessor in the post, and former chief, Sir George Everest.[4] Chomolungma had been in common use by Tibetans for centuries, but Waugh was unable to propose an established local name because Nepal and Tibet were closed to foreigners. (Pasted from wikipedia)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>For a user query ""Height of mount Everest"" from the paragraph I need to get 29002 ft or 8840 m as the answer. Can anyone please suggest any possible ways of doing it in Java?  Are there any open source libraries for the same?</p>
","java, parsing, nlp, tokenize","<p>Obviously, doing this well is extremely difficult to do. If it's an assignment though then I'm guessing the expectation is a bit lower. Here are some thoughts to hopefully get you started:</p>

<p>I'd split the problem into 2 parts; parsing the question block and then passing the answer block. From the question block, you need to know 2 pieces of information, the noun of what you're searching for, and also the type of the answer. In this case the noun is Everest and the type is height. ""Types"" of data you can build a dictionary for fairly quickly to search your input string for (e.g. ""height"", ""weight"", ""distance"", ""age""). The nouns are more difficult, so I'd say to just assume that every non-type in the question is a potential noun, perhaps removing a dictionary of known non-nouns (such as ""at"", ""the"", ""of"" etc.).</p>

<p>Once you've identified the noun and type from the question, you can begin scanning your answer block. I'd begin by breaking that up into sentences. Then scan each sentence for each of your nouns. If one is found in that sentence, you need to scan the sentence again for numbers (taking into account possible whitespace or comma delimiting). Finally, you need to look ""around"" any numbers you find for a measurement type. So in this case, your ""type"" that we parsed from the question was ""height"". You would need to create a mapping of types to measurements, so ""height"" would map ""km, ft, in, cm, m"" etc. If the number has one of these types around it, then return the number and measurement type as the answer.</p>

<p>Hope that gets you started. As stated above, this is not intended to be a robust, commercial solution. It's homework-level.</p>

<p>Something like <code>find . -type f -exec file {} \;</code> or <code>find . -type f -print0 | xargs -0 file</code> (only works if the command accepts multiple filenames during input).</p>

<p>Of course, if the program accepts multiple filename arguments (like <code>cat</code> or <code>more</code> or similar Unix shell tools) and all the files are in a single directory, you can very easily run: <code>cat *</code> (show contents of all files in the directory) or <code>cat *.*</code> (show contents of all files with a period in the filename).</p>

Hashtables over large natural language word sets,"<p>I'm writing a program in python to do a unigram (and eventually bigram etc) analysis of movie reviews.  The goal is to create feature vectors to feed into libsvm.  I have 50,000 odd unique words in my feature vector (which seems rather large to me, but I ham relatively sure I'm right about that).</p>

<p>I'm using the python dictionary implementation as a hashtable to keep track of new words as I meet them, but I'm noticing an enormous slowdown after the first 1000 odd documents are processed.  Would I have better efficiency (given the distribution of natural language) if I used several smaller hashtable/dictionaries or would it be the same/worse?</p>

<p>More info:</p>

<p>The data is split into 1500 or so documents, 500-ish words each.  There are between 100 and 300 unique words (with respect to all previous documents) in each document.</p>

<p>My current code:</p>

<pre><code>#processes each individual file, tok == filename, v == predefined class
def processtok(tok, v):
    #n is the number of unique words so far, 
    #reference is the mapping reference in case I want to add new data later
    #hash is the hashtable
    #statlist is the massive feature vector I'm trying to build
    global n
    global reference
    global hash
    global statlist
    cin=open(tok, 'r')
    statlist=[0]*43990
    statlist[0] = v
    lines = cin.readlines()
    for l in lines:
        line = l.split("" "")
        for word in line:
            if word in hash.keys():
                if statlist[hash[word]] == 0:
                    statlist[hash[word]] = 1
            else:
                hash[word]=n
                n+=1
                ref.write('['+str(word)+','+str(n)+']'+'\n')
                statlist[hash[word]] = 1
    cin.close()
    return statlist
</code></pre>

<p>Also keep in mind that my input data is about 6mb and my output data is about 300mb.  I'm simply startled at how long this takes, and I feel that it shouldn't be slowing down so dramatically as it's running.</p>

<p>Slowing down: the first 50 documents take about 5 seconds, the last 50 take about 5 minutes.</p>
","python, dictionary, nlp, hashtable, libsvm","<p>@ThatGuy has made the fix, but hasn't actually told you this: </p>

<p>The major cause of your slowdown is the line</p>

<p><code>if word in hash.keys():</code></p>

<p>which laboriously makes a list of all the keys so far, then laboriously searches that list for `word'. The time taken is proportional to the number of keys i.e. the number of unique words found so far. That's why it starts fast and becomes slower and slower.</p>

<p>All you need is <code>if word in hash:</code> which in 99.9999999% of cases takes time independent of the number of keys -- one of the major reasons for having a dict.</p>

<p>The faffing about with <code>statlist[hash[word]]</code> doesn't help, either. By the way, the fixed size in <code>statlist=[0]*43990</code> needs explanation.</p>

<p><strong>More problems</strong></p>

<p>Problem A: Either (1) your code suffered from indentation distortion when you published it, or (2) <code>hash</code> will never be updated by that function. Quite simply, if <code>word</code> is not in <code>hash</code> i.e it's the first time you've seen it, absolutely nothing happens. The <code>hash[word] = n</code> statement (the ONLY code that updates <code>hash</code>) is NOT executed. So no word will ever be in <code>hash</code>.</p>

<p>It looks like this block of code needs to be shifted left 4 columns, so that it's aligned with the outer <code>if</code>:</p>

<pre><code>else:
    hash[word]=n
    ref.write('['+str(word)+','+str(n)+']'+'\n')
    statlist[hash[word]] = 1
</code></pre>

<p>Problem B: There is no code at all to update <code>n</code> (allegedly the number of unique words so far).</p>

<p>I strongly suggest that you take as many of the suggestions that @ThatGuy and I have made as you care to, rip out all the <code>global</code> stuff, fix up your code, chuck in a few print statements at salient points, and run it over say 2 documents each of 3 lines with about 4 words in each. Ensure that it is working properly. THEN run it on your big data set (with the prints suppressed). In any case you may want to put out stats (like number of documents, lines, words, unique words, elapsed time, etc) at regular intervals.</p>

<p><strong>Another problem</strong></p>

<p>Problem C: I mentioned this in a comment on @ThatGuy's answer, and he agreed with me, but you haven't mentioned taking it up:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; line = ""foo bar foo\n""
&gt;&gt;&gt; line.split("" "")
['foo', 'bar', 'foo\n']
&gt;&gt;&gt; line.split()
['foo', 'bar', 'foo']
&gt;&gt;&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Your use of .split("" "") will lead to spurious ""words"" and distort your statistics, <em>including the number of unique words that you have</em>. You may well find the need to change that hard-coded magic number.</p>

<p>I say again: <em>There is no code that updates <code>n</code> in the function</em> . Doing <code>hash[word] = n</code> seems very strange, even if <code>n</code> is updated for each document.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For Python to understand that you are using UTF-8 encoding, you must include in the first or second line of your code, a line that looks like <code># coding=utf-8</code>. See <a href=""http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0263/"">PEP 0263</a> for details.</p></li>

Searching Natural Language Sentence Structure,"<p>What's the best way to store and search a database of natural language sentence structure  trees?</p>

<p>Using <a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenNLP's</a> English Treebank Parser, I can get fairly reliable sentence structure parsings for arbitrary sentences. What I'd like to do is create a tool that can extract all the doc strings from my source code, generate these trees for all sentences in the doc strings, store these trees and their associated function name in a database, and then allow a user to search the database using natural language queries.</p>

<p>So, given the sentence <code>""This uploads files to a remote machine.""</code> for the function <code>upload_files()</code>, I'd have the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(TOP
  (S
    (NP (DT This))
    (VP
      (VBZ uploads)
      (NP (NNS files))
      (PP (TO to) (NP (DT a) (JJ remote) (NN machine))))
    (. .)))
</code></pre>

<p>If someone entered the query ""How can I upload files?"", equating to the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(TOP
  (SBARQ
    (WHADVP (WRB How))
    (SQ (MD can) (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VB upload) (NP (NNS files))))
    (. ?)))
</code></pre>

<p>how would I store and query these trees in a SQL database?</p>

<p>I've written a simple proof-of-concept script that can perform this search using a mix of regular expressions and network graph parsing, but I'm not sure how I'd implement this in a  scalable way.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize my example would be trivial to retrieve using a simple keyword search. The idea I'm trying to test is how I might take advantage of grammatical structure, so I can weed-out entries with similar keywords, but a different sentence structure. For example, with the above query, I wouldn't want to retrieve the entry associated with the sentence <code>""Checks a remote machine to find a user that uploads files.""</code> which has similar keywords, but is obviously describing a completely different behavior.</p>
","sql, artificial-intelligence, scalability, nlp, machine-learning","<p>Relational databases cannot store knowledge in a natural way, what you actually need is a <strong>knowledge base</strong> or <strong>ontology</strong> (though it may be constructed on top of relational database). It holds data in triplets <code>&lt;subject, predicate, object&gt;</code>, so your phrase will be stored as <code>&lt;upload_file(), upload, file&gt;</code>. There's a lot of tools and methods to search inside such KBs (for example, Prolog is a language that was designed to do it). So, all you have to do is to translate sentences from natural language to <em>KB triplets/ontology graph</em>, translate user query to <em>incomplete triplets</em> (your question will look like <code>&lt;?, upload, file&gt;</code>) or <em>conjunctive queries</em> and then search on your KB. OpenNLP will help you with translating, and the rest depends on concrete technique and technologies you decide to use.  </p>

<p>It may be hard to find a large collection of news articles other than on each news source's website because of all the copyright issues involved.

Get words corresponding to a match from SpanNearQuery in Lucene,"<p>I would need to retrieve the words in my text that correspond to a match of Spans returned by SpanNearQuery.getSpans(). For instance, if my text is [a b c d e f] and I use SpanNearQueries with queries 'b' and 'e' (and sufficient slop), then I get a match 'b c d e' in my text. Now, how can I most efficiently retrieve the words as they appear in the match, that is, the sequence of words 'b c d e' itself?</p>

<p>Here is an example code of what I would need:</p>

<pre><code>SpanNearQuery allNear = new SpanNearQuery(spansTermQueries, numWordsInBetween, true);
Spans allSpans = allNear.getSpans(reader);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I would like to iterate over all the matches in allSpans, and for each match retrieve the exact words between the queries 9 the text that correspond to that match.</p>

<p>One indirect way is to get the end and start position of that match, read through the text document using a file reader, and find the string of text between position 'end' and 'start'. But that does not seem a very efficient way. It seems that this information should already be stored in the Lucene Index.</p>

","nlp, stanford-nlp, named-entity-recognition","<p>According to the EMNLP paper that describes the coref system packaged with Stanford CoreNLP, named entities tags are just used in the following coref annotation passes: <em>precise constructs</em>, <em>relaxed head matching</em>, and <em>pronouns</em> <a href=""http://cs.stanford.edu/people/nc/pubs/emnlp2010-sieve-coref.pdf"">(Raghunathan et al. 2010)</a>. </p>

<p>You can specify what passes to use with the <strong>dcoref.sievePasses</strong> configuration property. If you want coreference but you don't want to do NER, you should be able to just run the pipeline without NER and specify that the coref system should only use the annotation passes that don't require NER labels. </p>

<p>However, the resulting coref annotations will take a hit on <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recall_%28information_retrieval%29"">recall</a>.

Parsing a Syntax Tree with Perl Regex,"<p>Perhaps regex is not the best way to parse this, tell me if I it is not. Anyway, here are some examples of what the syntax tree looks like:</p>

<pre><code>(S (CC and))  
(SBARTMP (IN once) (NP otherstuff))   
(S (S (NP blah (VP blah)) (CC then) (NP blah (VP blah (PP blah))) ))   
</code></pre>

<p>Anyway, what I am trying to do is pull the connective out (and, then, once, etc) and its corresponding head (CC,IN,CC), which I already know for each syntax tree so it can act as an anchor, and I also need to retrieve its parent (in the first it is S, second SBARTMP, and third it is S), and its siblings, if there are any (in the first none, in the second left hand side sibling, and third left-hand-side and right-hand-side sibling). Anything higher than the parent is not included  </p>

<pre><code>my $pos = ""(\\\w|-)*"";  
my $sibling = qr{\s*(\\((?:(?&gt;[^()]+)|(?1))*\\))\s*};  
my $connective = ""once"";  
my $re = qr{(\(\w*\s*$sibling*\s*\\(IN\s$connective\\)\s*$sibling*\s*\))};  
</code></pre>

<p>This code works for things like:  </p>

<pre><code>my $test1 = ""(X (SBAR-TMP (IN once) (S sdf) (S sdf)))"";  
my $test2 = ""(X (SBAR-TMP (IN once))"";  
my $test3 = ""(X (SBAR-TMP (IN once) (X as))"";  
my $test4 = ""(X (SBAR-TMP (X adsf) (IN once))"";  
</code></pre>

<p>It will throw away the X on top and keep everything else, however, once the siblings have stuff embedded in them then it does not match because the regex does not go deeper.</p>

<pre><code>my $test = ""(X (SBAR-TMP (IN once) (MORE stuff (MORE stuff))))"";  
</code></pre>

<p>I am not sure how to account for this. I am kind of new to the extended patterns for Perl, just started learning it. To clarify a bit about what the regex is doing: it looks for the connective within two parentheses and the capital-letter/- combo, looks for a complete parent of the same format closing with two parentheses and then should look for any number of siblings that have all their parentheses paired off.</p>

How to find out if a sentence is a question (interrogative)?,"<p>Is there an open source Java library/algorithm for finding if a particular piece of text is a question or not?
<br/>
I am working on a question answering system that needs to analyze if the text input by user is a question.
<br/> 
I think the problem can probably be solved by using opensource NLP libraries but its obviously more complicated than simple part of speech tagging. So if someone can instead tell the algorithm for it by using an existing opensource NLP library, that would be good too.
<br/>
Also let me know if you know a library/toolkit that uses data mining to solve this problem. Although it will be difficult to get sufficient data for training purposes, I will be able to use stack exchange data for training.</p>
","java, algorithm, nlp, data-mining, text-processing","<p>In a syntactic parse of a question, the correct structure will be in the form of:</p>

<pre><code>(SBARQ (WH+ (W+) ...)
       (SQ ...*
           (V+) ...*)
       (?))
</code></pre>

<p>So, using anyone of the syntactic parsers available, a tree with an SBARQ node having an embedded SQ (optionally) will be an indicator the input is a question. The WH+ node (WHNP/WHADVP/WHADJP) contains the question stem (who/what/when/where/why/how) and the SQ holds the inverted phrase.</p>

<p>i.e.: </p>

  (SQ 
    (VBZ is) 
    (NP 
      (DT the) 
      (NN question)))
  (. ?))
</code></pre>

<p>Of course, having a lot of preceeding clauses will cause errors in the parse (that can be worked around), as will really poorly-written questions. For example, the title of this post ""How to find out if a sentence is a question?"" will have an SBARQ, but not an SQ.</p>

Get the word under the mouse cursor in Windows,"<p>Greetings everyone,</p>

<p>A friend and I are discussing the possibility of a new project: A translation program that will pop up a translation whenever you hover over any word in any control, even static, non-editable ones.  I know there are many browser plugins to do this sort of thing on webpages; we're thinking about how we would do it system-wide (on Windows).</p>

<p>Of course, the key difficulty is figuring out the word the user is hovering over.  I'm aware of MSAA and Automation, but as far as I can tell, those things only allow you to get the entire contents of a control, not the specific word the mouse is over.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon this (proprietary) application that does pretty much exactly what we want to do:  <a href=""http://www.gettranslateit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gettranslateit.com/</a></p>

<p>Somehow they are able to get the exact word the user is hovering over in almost any application (It seems to have trouble in a few apps, notably Windows Explorer).  It even grabs text out of obviously custom-drawn controls, somehow.  At first I thought it must be using OCR.  But even when I shrink the font so far down that the text becomes a completely unreadable blob, it can still recognize words perfectly.

Better distance metrics besides Levenshtein for ordered word sets and subsequent clustering,"<p>I am trying to solve a problem that involves comparing large numbers of word sets , each of which contains a large, ordered number of words from a set of words (totaling around 600+, very high dimensionality!) for similarity and then clustering them into distinct groupings. The solution needs to be as unsupervised as possible.</p>

<p>The data looks like</p>

<p>[Apple, Banana, Orange...]<br>
[Apple, Banana, Grape...] <br>
[Jelly, Anise, Orange...]<br>
[Strawberry, Banana, Orange...]<br>
...etc</p>

<p>The order of the words in each set matters ([Apple, Banana, Orange] is distinct from [Apple, Orange, Banana]</p>

<p>The approach I have been using so far has been to use Levenshtein distance (limited by a distance threshold) as a metric calculated in a Python script with each word being the unique identifier, generate a similarity matrix from the distances, and throwing that matrix into k-Mediods in KNIME for the groupings.</p>

<p>My questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Is Levenshtein the most appropriate distance metric to use for this problem?</li>
<li>Is mean/medoid prototype clustering the best way to go about the groupings?</li>
<li>I haven't yet put much thought into validating the choice for 'k' in the clustering. Would evaluating an SSE curve of the clustering be the best way to go about this?</li>
<li>Are there any flaws in my methodology? </li>
<li>As an extension to the solution in the future, given training data, would anyone happen to have any ideas for going about assigning probabilities to cluster assignments? For example, set 1 has a 80% chance of being in cluster 1, etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>I hope my questions don't seem too silly or the answers painfully obvious, I'm relatively new to data mining.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>
","algorithm, nlp, cluster-analysis, data-mining, levenshtein-distance","<p>Yes, Levenshtein is a very suitable way to do this.  But if the sequences vary in size much, you might be better off <strong>normalising</strong> these distances by dividing by the sum of the sequence lengths -- otherwise you will find that observed distances tend to increase for pairs of long sequences whose ""average distance"" (in the sense of the average distance between corresponding k-length substrings, for some small k) is constant.</p>

<p>Example: The pair <code>([Apple, Banana], [Carrot, Banana])</code> could be said to have the same ""average"" distance as <code>([Apple, Banana, Widget, Xylophone], [Carrot, Banana, Yam, Xylophone])</code> since every 2nd item matches in both, but the latter pair's raw Levenshtein distance will be twice as great.</p>

<p>Also bear in mind that Levenshtein does not make special allowances for <strong>""block moves""</strong>: if you take a string, and move one of its substrings sufficiently far away, then the resulting pair (of original and modified strings) will have the same Levenshtein score as if the 2nd string had completely different elements at the position where the substring was moved to.  If you want to take this into account, consider using a <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/451884/similar-string-algorithm/452956#452956"">compression-based distance</a> instead.  (Although I say there that it's useful for computing distances without respect to order, it does of course favour ordered similarity to disordered similarity.)</p>

What are the &quot;-P&quot;s in the Berkeley Aligner&#39;s output format?,"<p>I want to use the Berkeley Aligner for some MT research I'm doing, since, apparently, it beats GIZA++ pretty handily (a 32% alignment error reduction in some reported results).  For the most part the outputs in the Berkeley Aligner ""examples"" directory look like what Moses does to GIZA++ output files (i.e., paired aligned word indices), but there are some funny looking ""-P""s after certain pairs.  I can't for the life of me find any documentation  of what these ""-P"" annotations are supposed to signify (certainly not in the Berkeley Aligner ""documentation"" directory).</p>

<p>For clarity, I'll give a little illustrative example.  Suppose you have the sentences: ""Jean plÃ¢it Ã  Marie"" and ""Marie likes Jean"".  French is the source language and English is the target language. The words ""Jean"" (indices 0 and 2, resp.) and ""Marie"" (indices 3 and 0, resp.) are aligned in both sentences, and ""plÃ¢it"" and ""Ã  "" (French indices 1 and 2, resp.) are aligned with ""like"" (English index 1).

<p>The <strong>problem</strong> is if the hometown <strong>""California""</strong> is <strong>saved</strong> in <strong>English</strong> it will compare and retrieve the values. But <strong>""California""</strong> will be <strong>saved as ""ÙØ§ÙÙÙÙØ±ÙÙØ§"" in Arabic</strong>. In this case the <strong>hometown comparison fails</strong> and it cant retrieve the values. </p>

<p>I wish that my query should find both are same hometown and retrieve the values. Is it possible?</p>

<p>What <strong>alternate</strong> I should think of for this logic for comparison. I am confused. Any suggestion please? </p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
*<em>I have an Idea such that if the <strong>hometown</strong> is got then is it possible to use Google translator or transliterator and change the hometown to another language. if it is in english then to arabic or if it is in english then to arabic and give the search results joining both.

how to handle misspelled words in documents for text mining tasks?,"<p>I have a set of informal documents (couple of thousands) which I want to apply topic modeling (MALLET) on. The problem is, there are a considerable number of misspelled words in the documents. Most are intentional, such as short-forms and local lingo like `'juz' -> 'just', 'alr' -> 'already'. A couple of these variations exists, due to the different authors' peculiar styles of writing.</p>

<p>After feeding them to MALLET, I kinda bothered that one of the topics generated is actually a set of misspelled stopwords. I believe these words are mostly used in the small subset of documents from the same author, hence MALLET picked it up.</p>

<p>My question is, do I spell-check and correct these sets of misspelled words, and perhaps save the corrected text somewhere, before conducting further tasks on them?

<pre><code>Sex: Female
Symptoms: Heart burn
    Vomiting of blood
Death: True
Death Time: 11/11/2010 - 10:00am

<p>the order is not consistent by when I say in ....... so in is a keyword and all the text after is a place until i find another keyword<br>
At the beginnning He or She determine sex, got ........ whatever follows is a group of symptoms that i should split according to the separator which can be a comma, hypen or whatever but it's consistent for the same line<br>
died ..... hours later also should get how many hours, sometimes the patient is stil alive and discharged ....etc<br>
That's to say we have a lot of conventions and I think if i can tokenize the text with keywords and patterns i can get the job done. So please if you know a useful function/modules/tutorial/tool for doing that preferably in python (if not python so a gui tool would be nice)  </p>

Online job-searching is tedious. Help me automate it,"<p>Many job sites have broken searches that don't let you narrow down jobs by experience level. Even when they do, it's usually wrong. This requires you to wade through hundreds of postings that you can't apply for before finding a relevant one, quite tedious. Since I'd rather focus on writing cover letters etc., I want to write a program to look through a large number of postings, and save the URLs of just those jobs that don't require years of experience.</p>

<p>I don't require help writing the scraper to get the html bodies of possibly relevant job posts. The issue is accurately detecting the level of experience required for the job. This should not be too difficult as job posts are usually very explicit about this (""must have 5 years experience in...""), but there may be some issues with overly simple solutions.</p>

<p>In my case, I'm looking for entry-level positions. Often they don't say ""entry-level"", but inclusion of the words probably means the job should be saved.</p>

<p>Next, I can safely exclude a job the says it requires ""5 years"" of experience in whatever, so a regex like /\d\syears/ seems reasonable to exclude jobs. But then, I realized some jobs say they'll take 0-2 years of experience, matches the exclusion regex but is clearly a job I want to take a look at. Hmmm, I can handle that with another regex. But some say ""less than 2 years"" or ""fewer than 2 years"". Can handle that too, but it makes me wonder what other patterns I'm not thinking of, and possibly excluding many jobs. That's what brings me here, to find a better way to do this than regexes, if there is one.</p>

<p>I'd like to minimize the false negative rate and save all the jobs that seem like they might not require many years of experience. Does excluding anything that matches /[3-9]\syears|1\d\syears/ seem reasonable? Or is there a better way? Training a bayesian filter maybe?</p>

<p><strong>Edit:</strong> There's a similar, but harder problem, which would probably be more useful to solve. There are lots of jobs that just require an ""engineering degree"", as you just have to understand a few technical things. But searching for ""engineering"" gives you thousands of jobs, mostly irrelevant.</p>

<p>How do I narrow this down to just those jobs that require any engineering degree, rather than particular degrees, without looking at each myself?</p>

Justadistraction: tokenizing English without whitespaces. Murakami SheepMan,"<p>I wondered how <strong>you</strong> would go about tokenizing strings in English (or other western languages) if whitespaces were removed?</p>

<p>The inspiration for the question is the Sheep Man character in the Murakami novel '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Dance"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dance Dance Dance</a>'</p>

<p>In the novel, the Sheep Man is translated as saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""likewesaid, we'lldowhatwecan. Trytoreconnectyou, towhatyouwant,"" said the Sheep Man. ""Butwecan'tdoit-alone. Yougottaworktoo.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, some punctuation is kept, but not all. Enough for a human to read, but somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<p>What would be your strategy for building a parser for this? Common combinations of letters, syllable counts, conditional grammars, look-ahead/behind regexps etc.?</p>

<p>Specifically, python-wise, how would you structure a (forgiving) translation flow? Not asking for a completed answer, just more how your thought process would go about breaking the problem down.</p>

<p>I ask this in a frivolous manner, but I think it's a question that might get some interesting (nlp/crypto/frequency/social) answers.

"Dictionary-Based Named Entity Recognition with zero edit distance: LingPipe, Lucene or what?","<p>I'm trying to perform a dictionary-based NER on some documents. My dictionary, regardless of the datatype, consists of key-value pairs of strings. I want to search for all the keys in the document, and return the corresponding value for that key whenever a match occurs.</p>

<p>The problem is, my dictionary is fairly large: ~7 million key-values - average length of keys: 8 and average length of values: 20 characters.</p>

<p>I've tried LingPipe with MapDictionary but on my desired environment setup, it runs out of memory after 200,000 rows are inserted. I don't know clearly why LingPipe uses a map and not a hashmap in their algorithm.</p>

<p>So the thing is, I don't have any previous experience with Lucene and I want to know if it makes such thing with such number possible in an easier way.</p>

<p>ps. I've already tried chunking the data into several dictionaries and writing them on disk but it's relatively slow.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>Cheers

Improving entity naming with custom file/code in NLTK,"<p>We've been working with the NLTK library in a recent project where we're 
mainly interested in the named entities part. </p>

<p>In general we're getting good results using the NEChunkParser class. 
However, we're trying to find a way to provide our own terms to the 
parser, without success. </p>

<p>For example, we have a test document where my name (Shay) appears in 
several places. The library finds me as GPE while I'd like it to find 
me as PERSON... </p>

code so the parser will be able to interpret the named entity as I 
want it to? </p>

How can I make this Python2.6 function work with Unicode?,"<p>I've got this function, which I modified from material in chapter 1 of the online NLTK book. It's been very useful to me but, despite reading the chapter on Unicode, I feel just as lost as before.</p>

<p>When I tried it the other day on Also Sprach Zarathustra, it clobbered words with an umlat over the o's and u's. I'm sure some of you will know why that happened. I'm also sure that it's quite easy to fix. I know that it just has to do with calling a function that re-encodes the tokens into unicode strings. If so, that it seems to me it might not happen inside that function definition at all, but here, where I prepare to write to file:</p>

<pre><code>def jotindex(jotted, filename, readmethod):
    filemydata = open(filename, readmethod)
    jottedf = '\n'.join(jotted)
    filemydata.write(jottedf)
    filemydata.close()
    return 0

<p>I heard that what I had to do was encode the string into unicode after reading it from the file. I tried amending the function like so:</p>

<pre><code>def openbookreturnvocab(book):
    fileopen = open(book)
    rawness = fileopen.read()
    unirawness = rawness.decode('utf-8')
    tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(unirawness)

    nltkwords = [w.lower() for w in nltktext]
    nltkvocab = sorted(set(nltkwords))
    return nltkvocab

","python, unicode, nlp, python-2.6, nltk","<p>For each string that you read from your file, you can convert them to unicode by calling <code>rawness.decode('utf-8')</code>, if you have the text in UTF-8.

<h3>Update:</h3>

<p>It appears that the NLTK library doesn't like unicode objects.  Fine, then you have to make sure that you are using str instances with UTF-8 encoded text.  Try using this:</p>

<pre><code>tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(unirawness)

<p>By the way, it looks as though NLTK isn't very cautious with respect to unicode and encoding (at least, the demos).  Better be careful and check that it has processed your tokens correctly.

Transforming early modern English into 20th century spelling using the NLTK,"<p>I have a list of strings that are all early modern English words ending with 'th.' These include hath, appointeth, demandeth, etc. -- they are all conjugated for the third person singular.</p>

<p>As part of a much larger project (using my computer to convert the Gutenberg etext of Gargantua and Pantagruel into something more like 20th century English, so that I'll be able to read it more easily) I want to remove the last two or three characters from all of those words and replace them with an 's,' then use a slightly modified function on the words that still weren't modernized, both included below.</p>

    if word.endswith('es'):

<p>hence the words 'abateth' and 'accuseth' would pass through ethrema but not through ethremb(ethrema), while the word 'abhorreth' would need to pass through both.</p>

Tools for getting intent from Twitter statuses?,"<p>I am considering a project in which a publication's content is augmented by relevant, publicly available tweets from people in the area.

Binarization in Natural Language Processing,"<p>Binarization is the act of transforming colorful features of of an entity into vectors of numbers, most often binary vectors, to make good examples for classifier algorithms.</p>

<p>If we where to binarize the sentence ""The cat ate the dog"", we could start by assigning every word an ID (for example cat-1, ate-2, the-3, dog-4) and then simply replace the word by it's ID giving the vector &lt;3,1,2,3,4>. </p>

<p>Given these IDs we could also create a binary vector by giving each word four possible slots, and setting the slot corresponding to a specific word with to one, giving the vector &lt;0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1>. The latter method is, as far as I know, is commonly referred to as the bag-of-words-method.</p>

<p>Now for my question, what is the <i>best</i> binarization method when it comes to describe features for natural language processing in general, and transition-based <i>dependency parsing</i> (with Nivres algorithm) in particular? </p>

<p>In this context, we do not want to encode the whole sentence, but rather the current state of the parse, for example the top word on the stack en the first word in the input queue. Since order is highly relevant, this rules out the bag-of-words-method. </p>

<p>With <i>best</i>, I am referring to the method that makes the data the most intelligible for the classifier, without using up unnecessary memory. For example I don't want a word bigram to use 400 million features for 20000 unique words, if only 2% the bigrams actually exist.</p>

<p>Since the answer is also depending on the particular classifier, I am mostly interested in maximum entropy models (liblinear), support vector machines (libsvm) and perceptrons, but answers that apply to other models are also welcome.</p>
","machine-learning, nlp, classification, libsvm","<p>This is actually a really complex question. The first decision you have to make is whether to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lemmatization"" rel=""noreferrer"">lemmatize</a> your input tokens (your words). If you do this, you dramatically decrease your type count, and your syntax parsing gets a lot less complicated. However, it takes a lot of work to lemmatize a token. Now, in a computer language, this task gets greatly reduced, as most languages separate keywords or variable names with a well defined set of symbols, like whitespace or a period or whatnot.</p>

<p>The second crucial decision is what you're going to do with the data post-facto. The ""bag-of-words"" method, in the binary form you've presented, ignores word order, which is completely fine if you're doing <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_summarization"" rel=""noreferrer"">summarization of a text</a> or maybe a Google-style search where you don't care <em>where</em> the words appear, as long as they appear. If, on the other hand, you're building something like a compiler or parser, order is very much important. You can use the token-vector approach (as in your second paragraph), or you can extend the bag-of-words approach such that each non-zero entry in the bag-of-words vector contains the linear index position of the token in the phrase.</p>

<p>Finally, if you're going to be building <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parse_tree"" rel=""noreferrer"">parse trees</a>, there are obvious reasons why you'd want to go with the token-vector approach, as it's a big hassle to maintain sub-phrase ids for every word in the bag-of-words vector, but very easy to make ""sub-vectors"" in a token-vector. In fact, Eric Brill used a token-id sequence for his <a href=""http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/areas/nlp/parsing/taggers/brill/0.html"" rel=""noreferrer"">part-of-speech tagger</a>, which is really neat.</p>

"Extract inconsistently formatted date from string (date parsing, NLP)","<p>I have a large list of files, some of which have dates embedded in the filename.  The format of the dates is inconsistent and often incomplete, e.g. ""Aug06"", ""Aug2006"", ""August 2006"", ""08-06"", ""01-08-06"", ""2006"", ""011004"" etc.  In addition to that, some filenames have unrelated numbers that look somewhat like dates, e.g. ""20202010"".</p>

<p>In short, the dates are normally incomplete, sometimes not there, are inconsistently formatted and are embedded in a string with other information, e.g. ""Report Aug06.xls"".</p>

<p>Are there any Perl modules available which will do a decent job of guessing the date from such a string?  It doesn't have to be 100% correct, as it will be verified by a human manually, but I'm trying to make things as easy as possible for that person and there are thousands of entries to check :)</p>

           ""Annual Report-08-06"", ""End-of-month Report01-08-06.xls"", ""Report2006"");

# assumption - longest likely date string is something like '11th September 2006' - 19 chars
# shortest is ""2006"" - 4 chars.
# brute force all strings from 19-4 chars long at the end of the filename (less extension)
# return the longest thing that Date::Parse recognises as a date

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: RTM is todo list system. So in order to enter a task you don't need to type in each field to fill values (task name, due date, location, etc). You can simply type in a phrase like ""Dentist appointment monday at 2PM in WhateverPlace"" and it will parse it and fill all fields for you.</p>

I'm much more of a verbal person than a math-oriented person, so I haven't figured out how to do that yet, and the manual goes into way too much detail about stuff I don't actually want to do. I'm assuming it's just one or two more lines of code, though. </p>
","python, text, set, nlp, nltk","<p>If your English dictionary is indeed a set (hopefully of lowercased words),</p>

(It's a pity that you turned <code>vocab</code> into a list by that <code>sorted</code>, since you need to turn it back into a set to perform operations such as this set difference!).</p>

<p>If your English dictionary is in some different format, not really a set or not comprised only of lowercased words, you'll have to tell us what that format is for us to be able to help!-)</p>

<p>If you're keen to have a list as the result instead of a set, <code>sorted(newwords)</code> will give you an alphabetically sorted list (<code>list(newwords)</code> would give you a list a bit faster, but in totally arbitrary order, and I suspect you'd rather wait a tiny extra amount of time and get, in return, a nicely alphabetized result;-).</p>

How to find common phrases in a large body of text,"<p>I'm working on a project at the moment where I need to pick out the most common phrases in a huge body of text. For example say we have three sentences like the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>The dog jumped</strong> over the woman.</li>
<li><strong>The dog jumped</strong> into the car.</li>
<li><strong>The dog jumped</strong> up the stairs.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the above example I would want to extract ""<em>the dog jumped</em>"" as it is the most common phrase in the text. At first I thought, ""oh lets use a directed graph [with repeated nodes]"":</p>

<p><a href=""http://img.skitch.com/20091218-81ii2femnfgfipd9jtdg32m74f.png"">directed graph http://img.skitch.com/20091218-81ii2femnfgfipd9jtdg32m74f.png</a></p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: Apologies, I made a mistake while making this diagram ""over"", ""into"" and ""up"" should all link back to ""the"".</p>

<p>I was going to maintain a count of how many times a word occurred in each node object (""the"" would be 6; ""dog"" and ""jumped"", 3; etc.) but despite many other problems the main one came up when we add a few more examples like (please ignore the bad grammar :-)): </p>

<ul>
<li>Dog jumped up and down.</li>
<li>Dog jumped like no dog had ever jumped before.</li>
<li>Dog jumped happily.</li>
</ul>

<p>We now have a problem since ""<em>dog</em>"" would start a new root node (at the same level as ""the"") and we would not identify ""<em>dog jumped</em>"" as now being the most common phrase. So now I am thinking maybe I could use an undirected graph to map the relationships between all the words and eventually pick out the common phrases but I'm not sure how this is going to work either, as you lose the important relationship of order between the words. </p>

<p>So does anyone have any general ideas on how to identify common phrases in a large body of text and what data structure I would use.</p>

"Perl and NLP, parse Names out of Biographies","<p>I'm pretty new to NLP in general, but getting really good at Perl, and I was wondering what kind of powerful NLP modules are out there. Basically, I have a file with a bunch of paragraphs, and some of them are people's biographies. So, first I need to look for a person's name, and that helps with the rest of the process later.</p>

<p>So I was roughly starting with something like this:</p>

<pre><code>foreach $PPid (0 .. $PPscalar) {
$paragraph = @PP[$PPid];
if ($paragraph =~ /^(\w+ \w\. \w+|\w+ \w+)( also|)( has served| served| worked| joined| currently serves| has| was| is|, )/){
    $possibleName = $1;
    $badName = 0;
    foreach $piece (@pieces){
    if ($possibleName =~ /$piece/){
        $badName = 1;
    }
    }
    if ($badName == 0){
    push @namePile, $possibleName;
    }
}

}
</code></pre>

<p>Because most of the names start at the beginning of the paragraphs. And then I'm looking for keywords that denote action or possession, but right now, that picks up extra junk that is not a name. There has to be a module to do this, right?</p>

Identifying collocation in Stanford POS Tagger?,"<p>Is the Stanford POS tagger able to detect collocation? If so, how do I use it?</p>

Evaluating the &quot;Value&quot; Attribute,"<p>I'm attempting to use the <a href=""http://www.openamplify.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">OpenAmplify</a> <a href=""http://community.openamplify.com/content/2dot0docs.aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">API</a> to evaluate the content of a URI.

<ol>
<li>Huge, and</li>
<li>Varied</li>
</ol>

<p>Neither quality is terribly useful for what I'm trying to do because the signal to noise ratio is being heavily skewed towards noise. I'm analyzing web content, so there is a certain amount (perhaps a large amount) of irrelevant content (ads, etc.) involved. I get that. </p>

<p>Nonetheless, many of the topics being returned are either useless (utterly non-sensical, not even words), irrelevant (as in, where did that come from?) or too granular to provide any meaning or insight. I can probably filter out most of this noise using the <strong>value</strong>, um, value that is returned for each domain, subdomain, topic, et al, but I don't really know what it means. </p>

<p>Certainly I understand that the <strong>value</strong> it's a measure of ""the prominence of the word in the text,"" but the number itself appears entirely arbitrary in a way that I prevents me saying something like ""ignore any terms with a value less than 50"" and have it carry any real meaning.</p>

<p>Are there any range criteria that I can use to help me understand how to use a topic's value score as a filtering threshold? Alternatively, is there another field that I should be using for this sort of filtration?</p>

Probabilistic Generation of Semantic Networks,"<p>I've studied some simple semantic network implementations and basic techniques for parsing natural language. However, I haven't seen many projects that try and bridge the gap between the two.</p>

<p>For example, consider the dialog:</p>

<pre><code>""the man has a hat""
""he has a coat""
""what does he have?"" =&gt; ""a hat and coat""
</code></pre>

<p>A simple semantic network, based on the grammar tree parsing of the above sentences, might look like:</p>

<pre><code>the_man = Entity('the man')
has = Entity('has')
a_hat = Entity('a hat')
a_coat = Entity('a coat')
Relation(the_man, has, a_hat)
Relation(the_man, has, a_coat)
print the_man.relations(has) =&gt; ['a hat', 'a coat']
</code></pre>

<p>However, this implementation assumes the prior knowledge that the text segments ""the man"" and ""he"" refer to the same network entity.</p>

<p>How would you design a system that ""learns"" these relationships between segments of a semantic network? I'm used to thinking about ML/NL problems based on creating a simple training set of attribute/value pairs, and feeding it to a classification or regression algorithm, but I'm having trouble formulating this problem that way.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it seems I would need to overlay probabilities on top of the semantic network, but that would drastically complicate an implementation. Is there any prior art along these lines? I've looked at a few libaries, like NLTK and OpenNLP, and while they have decent tools to handle symbolic logic and parse natural language, neither seems to have any kind of proabablilstic framework for converting one to the other.</p>
","machine-learning, data-mining, nlp","<p>There is quite a lot of history behind this kind of task. Your best start is probably by looking at <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Question_answering"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Question Answering</a>. </p>

<p>The general advice I always give is that if you have some highly restricted domain where you know about all the things that might be mentioned and all the ways they interact then you can probably be quite successful. If this is more of an 'open-world' problem then it will be extremely difficult to come up with something that works acceptably.</p>

<p>The task of extracting relationship from natural language is called 'relationship extraction' (funnily enough) and sometimes fact extraction. This is a pretty large field of research, <a href=""http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/~razvan/papers/thesis-white.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this guy</a> did a PhD thesis on it, as have many others. There are a large number of challenges here, as you've noticed, like entity detection, anaphora resolution, etc. This means that there will probably be a lot of 'noise' in the entities and relationships you extract.</p>

<p>As for representing facts that have been extracted in a knowledge base, most people tend not to use a probabilistic framework. At the simplest level, entities and relationships are stored as triples in a flat table. Another approach is to use an ontology to add structure and allow reasoning over the facts. This makes the knowledge base vastly more useful, but adds a lot of scalability issues. As for adding probabilities, I know of the <a href=""http://www.pr-owl.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Prowl</a> project that is aimed at creating a probabilistic ontology, but it doesn't look very mature to me.</p>

<p>There is some research into probabilistic relational modelling, mostly into <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_logic_network"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Markov Logic Networks</a> at the University of Washington and <a href=""http://dags.stanford.edu/PRMs/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Probabilstic Relational Models</a> at Stanford and other places. I'm a little out of touch with the field, but this is is a difficult problem and it's all early-stage research as far as I know. There are a lot of issues, mostly around efficient and scalable inference.</p>

<p>All in all, it's a good idea and a very sensible thing to want to do. However, it's also very difficult to achieve.

Additional research on ""Natural Language Parsing"" (NLP) yields results which are MUCH broader than what I feel is actually implemented in something like ""Quick Add"".

<p>then <code>realnum.parseString(""3.14"")</code> will return '3.14' (which you could then convert to a float using a parse action).

<p>Here is my task:</p>

<ol>
<li>I start with one long piece of data (lets say several hundred tweets on the subject of the UK election from their webservice)</li>
<li>I would like to break this up into sentences (or info no longer than 100 or so chars) (I guess i can just do this in python??)</li>
<li>Then to search through all the sentences for specific instances within that sentence e.g. ""David Cameron""</li>
<li>Then I would like to check for positive/negative sentiment in each sentence and count them accordingly</li>

<p>Here are the troubles I am having:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>All the data sets I can find e.g. the corpus movie review data that comes with NLTK arent in webservice format. It looks like this has had some processing done already. As far as I can see the processing (by stanford) was done with WEKA. Is it not possible for NLTK to do all this on its own? Here all the data sets have already been organised into positive/negative already e.g. polarity dataset <a href=""http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/pabo/movie-review-data/</a> How is this done? (to organise the sentences by sentiment, is it definitely WEKA? or something else?)</p></li>
<li><p>I am not sure I understand why WEKA and NLTK would be used together. Seems like they do much the same thing. If im processing the data with WEKA first to find sentiment why would I need NLTK? Is it possible to explain why this might be necessary?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>I have found a few scripts that get somewhat near this task, but all are using the same pre-processed data. Is it not possible to process this data myself to find sentiment in sentences rather than using the data samples given in the link?</p>

<p>Any help is much appreciated and will save me much hair!</p>

","nlp, nltk, weka, classification","<p>The movie review data has already been marked by humans as being positive or negative (the person who made the review gave the movie a rating which is used to determine polarity).  These <em>gold standard</em> labels allow you to train a classifier, which you could then use for other movie reviews.  You could train a classifier in NLTK with that data, but applying the results to election tweets might be less accurate than randomly guessing positive or negative.

","language-agnostic, parsing, nlp","<p>In his article <a href=""http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">How to Write a Spelling Corrector</a>, Peter Norvig discusses how a Google-like spellchecker could be implemented. The article contains a 20-line implementation in Python, as well as links to several reimplementations in C, C++, C# and Java. Here is an excerpt:</p>

  90% accuracy at a processing speed of
  at least 10 words per second.</p>

Theory: &quot;Lexical Encoding&quot;,"<p><strong>I am using the term ""Lexical Encoding"" for my lack of a better one.</strong></p>

<p>A Word is arguably the fundamental unit of communication as opposed to a Letter.  Unicode tries to assign a numeric value to each Letter of all known Alphabets.  What is a Letter to one language, is a Glyph to another.  Unicode 5.1 assigns more than 100,000 values to these Glyphs currently.  Out of the approximately 180,000 Words being used in Modern English, it is said that with a vocabulary of about 2,000 Words, you should be able to converse in general terms. A ""Lexical Encoding"" would encode each Word not each Letter, and encapsulate them within a Sentence.</p>

<pre><code>// An simplified example of a ""Lexical Encoding""
String sentence = ""How are you today?"";
int[] sentence = { 93, 22, 14, 330, QUERY };
</code></pre>

<p>In this example each Token in the String was encoded as an Integer. The Encoding Scheme here simply assigned an int value based on generalised statistical ranking of word usage, and assigned a constant to the question mark.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a Word has both a Spelling &amp; Meaning though.  Any ""Lexical Encoding"" would preserve the meaning and intent of the Sentence as a whole, and not be language specific.  An English sentence would be encoded into <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/170452/linguistics-lexical-encoding#174249"">""...language-neutral atomic elements of meaning ...""</a> which could then be reconstituted into any language with a structured Syntactic Form and Grammatical Structure.</p>

<p>What are other examples of ""Lexical Encoding"" techniques?</p>

<hr>

<p>If you were interested in where the word-usage statistics come from :<br>
<a href=""http://www.wordcount.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.wordcount.org</a></p>
","encoding, theory, nlp, linguistics","<p>Their are several major problems with this idea. In most languages, the meaning of a word, and the word associated with a meaning change very swiftly.</p>

<p>No sooner would you have a number assigned to a word, before the meaning of the word would change. For instance, the word ""gay"" used to only mean ""happy"" or ""merry"", but it is now used mostly to mean homosexual. Another example is the morpheme ""thank you"" which originally came from German ""danke"" which is just one word. Yet another example is ""Good bye"" which is a shortening of ""God bless you"".</p>

<p>Another problem is that even if one takes a snapshot of a word at any point of time, the meaning and usage of the word would be under contention, even within the same province. When dictionaries are being written, it is not uncommon for the academics responsible to argue over a single word.</p>

<p>In short, you wouldn't be able to do it with an existing language. You would have to consider inventing a language of your own, for the purpose, or using a fairly static language that has already been invented, such as Interlingua or Esperanto. However, even these would not be perfect for the purpose of defining static morphemes in an ever-standard lexicon.</p>

<p>Even in Chinese, where there is rough mapping of character to meaning, it still would not work. Many characters change their meanings depending on both context, and which characters either precede or postfix them.</p>

<p>The problem is at its worst when you try and translate between languages. There may be one word in English, that can be used in various cases, but cannot be directly used in another language. An example of this is ""free"". In Spanish, either ""libre"" meaning ""free"" as in speech, or ""gratis"" meaning ""free"" as in beer can be used (and using the wrong word in place of ""free"" would look very funny).</p>

<p>There are other words which are even more difficult to place a meaning on, such as the word beautiful in Korean; when calling a girl beautiful, there would be several candidates for substitution; but when calling food beautiful, unless you mean the food is good looking, there are several other candidates which are completely different.</p>

<p>What it comes down to, is although we only use about 200k words in English, our vocabularies are actually larger in some aspects because we assign many different meanings to the same word. The same problems apply to Esperanto and Interlingua, and every other language meaningful for conversation. Human speech is not a well-defined, well oiled-machine. So, although you could create such a lexicon where each ""word"" had it's own unique meaning, it would be very difficult, and nigh on impossible for machines using current techniques to translate from any human language into your special standardised lexicon.</p>

<p>This is why machine translation still sucks, and will for a long time to come. If you can do better (and I hope you can) then you should probably consider doing it with some sort of scholarship and/or university/government funding, working towards a PHD; or simply make a heap of money, whatever keeps your ship steaming.</p>

Keyword sorting algorithm,"<p>I have over 1000 surveys, many of which contains open-ended replies. </p>

<p>I would like to be able to 'parse' in all the words and get a ranking of the most used words (disregarding common words) to spot a trend.</p>

<p>How can I do this? Is there a program I can use?</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong> If a 3rd party solution is not available, it would be great if we can keep the discussion to microsoft technologies only. Cheers.</p>
","c#, sorting, nlp, data-mining, ranking","<p>Divide and conquer.  Split up your problem into many smaller problems and solve each of them.</p>

<p>First problem: turn a paragraph into a list of words.</p>

<p>You are fortunate because you don't have to worry about being perfect. Actually parsing natural languages to determine exactly what ""a word"" is can be very difficult, but frankly you probably don't really care whether ""lightbulb"" has the the same semantics as ""light bulb"". Since you are in particular looking for common words (for now, more on that later) the interesting ones are precisely those that <em>are</em> easy to identify because they come up a lot.</p>

<p>So, break this problem down further. You want a list of words. Start by getting a string with the text in it:</p>

<pre><code>StreamReader streamReader = new StreamReader(@""c:\survey.txt"");
string source = streamReader.ReadToEnd();
</code></pre>

<p>Great, you've got a string somehow. Now turn that into an array of words.  Because you probably want to count ""Frog"" and ""frog"" as the same word, make everything lowercase. How to do all that that? Split the lowercase string up based on spaces, newlines, tabs and punctuation:</p>

<pre><code>char[] punctuation = new char[] {' ', '\n', '\r', '\t', '(', ')', '""'};
string[] tokens = source.ToLower().Split(punctuation, true); 
</code></pre>

<p>Now examine the output. That was terrible. There's all kinds of stuff we forget. Periods and commas and colons and semicolons and so on. Figure out which punctuation you care about and add it to the list.</p>

<p>Is ToLower the right thing to do? What about ToLowerInvariant? There are times you want to stress about it; this isn't one of them. The fact that ToLower doesn't necessarily canoncialize the Turkish lowercase I in a manner that consistently round-trips is unlikely to throw off your summary statistics. We're not going for pinpoint accuracy here. If someone says ""luxury-yacht"", and someone says ""luxury yacht"", the former might be one word if you forget to break on hyphens. Who cares? Hyphenated words are unlikely to be in your top ten anyway.</p>

<p>Next problem: count all the occurrences of each word:</p>

<pre><code>var firstPass = new Dictionary&lt;string, int&gt;();
foreach(string token in tokens)
{
    if (!firstPass.ContainsKey(token))
        firstPass[token] = 1;
    else
        ++firstPass[token];
} 
</code></pre>

<p>Great. We now have a dictionary that maps words to integers. Trouble is, that's backwards. What you want to know is what are all the words that have the same number of occurrences. A dictionary is a sequence of key/value pairs, so group it:</p>

<pre><code>var groups = from pair in firstPass
             group pair.Key by pair.Value;
</code></pre>

<p>OK, now we have a sequence of groups of words, each one associated with its count of occurrences. Order it. Remember, the key of the group is the value of the dictionary, the count:</p>

<pre><code>var sorted = from group in groups
             orderby group.Key
             select group;
</code></pre>

<p>And you want the top hundred, let's say:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(var g in sorted.Take(100))
{
  Console.WriteLine(""Words with count {0}:"", g.Key);
  foreach(var w in g)
    Console.WriteLine(w);
}
</code></pre>

<p>And you're done.</p>

<p>Now, is this really what you're interested in?  I think it might be more interesting to look for <em>unusual</em> words, or pairs of words. If the words ""yacht"" and ""racing"" show up together a lot, not a surprise. If ""tomato"" and ""ketchup"" show up a lot together, not surprising. If ""tomato"" and ""racing"" start showing up together, then maybe something noteworthy is going on.</p>

<p>That requires much deeper analysis; read up on Bayes' Theorem if that's the sort of thing you're interested in.</p>

<p>Also note that this tracks the <em>raw count</em> of words, not their <em>frequency</em> -- the number of times they appear <em>per thousand words</em>. That might also be an interesting metric to measure: not just how many times did this word appear, period, but how many times did it appear as a percentage of the text.</p>

Java Stanford NLP: Spell checking,"<p>I'm trying to check spelling accuracy of text samples using the Stanford NLP. It's just a metric of the text, not a filter or anything, so if it's off by a bit it's fine, as long as the error is uniform.</p>

<p>My first idea was to check if the word is known by the lexicon:</p>

<pre><code>private static LexicalizedParser lp = new LexicalizedParser(""englishPCFG.ser.gz"");

@Analyze(weight=25, name=""Spelling"")
    public double spelling() {
        int result = 0;

        for (List&lt;? extends HasWord&gt; list : sentences) {
            for (HasWord w : list) {
                if (! lp.getLexicon().isKnown(w.word())) {
                    System.out.format(""misspelled: %s\n"", w.word());
                    result++;
                }
            }
        }

        return result / sentences.size();
    }
</code></pre>

<p>However, this produces quite a lot of false positives:</p>

<pre><code>misspelled: Sincerity
misspelled: Sisyphus
misspelled: Sisyphus
misspelled: fidelity
misspelled: negates
misspelled: gods
misspelled: henceforth

","java, nlp, stanford-nlp, spell-checking","<p>Using the parser's lexicon's isKnown(String) method as a spellchecker isn't a viable use case of the parser.  The method is correct: ""false"" means that this word was not seen (with the given capitalization) in the approximately 1 million words of text the parser is trained from.  But 1 million words just isn't enough text to train a comprehensive spellchecker from in a data-driven manner. People would typically use at least two orders of magnitude of text more, and might well add some cleverness to handle capitalization.  The parser includes some of this cleverness to handle words that were unseen in the training data, but this isn't reflected in what the isKnown(String) method returns.</p>

They count how many times they reach the nodes corresponding to non-seed entities. Non-seed entities with high counts can then be used to complete the cluster.</p>

While this particular text seems to make sense (except it's horrible), the other examples I've seen (yet can't find now) are just some rubbish, whose purpose is to get some users from Google and get banned 1 day after creation.</p>
","machine-learning, nlp, spam, information-retrieval","<p><strong>N-gram Language Models</strong></p>

<p>You could try training one <strong><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">n-gram language model</a></strong> on the autogenerated spam pages and one on a collection of other non-spam webpages.</p>

<p>You could then simply score new pages with both language models to see if the text looks more similar to the spam webpages or regular web content. </p>

<p><strong>Better Scoring through Bayes Law</strong></p>

<p>When you score a text with the spam language model, you get an estimate of the probability of finding that text on a spam web page, <code>P(Text|Spam)</code>. The notation reads as the probability of <code>Text</code> given <code>Spam (page)</code>. The score from the non-spam language model is an estimate of the probability of finding the text on a non-spam web page, <code>P(Text|Non-Spam)</code>. </p>

<p>However, the term you probably really want is <code>P(Spam|Text)</code> or, equivalently <code>P(Non-Spam|Text)</code>. That is, you want to know <strong>the probability that a page is <code>Spam</code> or <code>Non-Spam</code> given the text that appears on it</strong>.</p>

<p>To get either of these, you'll need to use <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayes%27_theorem"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>Bayes Law</strong></a>, which states</p>

<pre><code>           P(B|A)P(A)
P(A|B) =  ------------
              P(B)
</code></pre>

<p>Using Bayes law, we have</p>

<pre><code>P(Spam|Text)=P(Text|Spam)P(Spam)/P(Text)
</code></pre>

<p>and</p>

<pre><code>P(Non-Spam|Text)=P(Text|Non-Spam)P(Non-Spam)/P(Text)
</code></pre>

<p><code>P(Spam)</code> is your <strong>prior belief</strong> that a page selected at random from the web is a spam page. You can estimate this quantity by counting how many spam web pages there are in some sample, or you can even use it as a parameter that you manually <strong>tune to trade-off <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Precision_and_recall"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">precision and recall</a></strong>. For example, giving this parameter a high value will result in fewer spam pages being mistakenly classified as non-spam, while given it a low value will result in fewer non-spam pages being accidentally classified as spam.</p>

<p>The term <code>P(Text)</code> is the overall probability of finding <code>Text</code> on any webpage. If we ignore that <code>P(Text|Spam)</code> and <code>P(Text|Non-Spam)</code> were determined using different models, this can be calculated as <code>P(Text)=P(Text|Spam)P(Spam) + P(Text|Non-Spam)P(Non-Spam)</code>. This sums out the binary variable <code>Spam</code>/<code>Non-Spam</code>. </p>

<p><strong>Classification Only</strong></p>

<p>However, if you're not going to use the probabilities for anything else, you don't need to calculate <code>P(Text)</code>. Rather, you can just compare the numerators <code>P(Text|Spam)P(Spam)</code> and <code>P(Text|Non-Spam)P(Non-Spam)</code>. If the first one is bigger, the page is most likely a spam page, while if the second one is bigger the page is mostly likely non-spam. This works since the equations above for both <code>P(Spam|Text)</code> and <code>P(Non-Spam|Text)</code> are normalized by the <strong>same</strong> <code>P(Text)</code> value. </p>

<p><strong>Tools</strong></p>

<p>In terms of software toolkits you could use for something like this, <a href=""http://www-speech.sri.com/projects/srilm/download.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SRILM</a> would be a good place to start and it's free for non-commercial use.

","nlp, spell-checking","<p>What you want is a similarity factor.  Essentially, you want to compare your inputs (""Micheal Jackson"", for example) to your expected values (""Michael Jackson""); if you score a very high similarity value to one of your expected values, you can ask the user.</p>

<p>One way of doing this is to hash the expected values into a fully packed hashtable.  If you get your hashing algorithm right (and yes, this is the tricky bit), each input will hash to the closest expected value; once you've found the closest expected value, you can run a similarity evaluation against the input and that expected value; if you're above a certain threshold, ask the user.</p>

<p>Before reinventing the wheel, I need to know whether such method exists. Stripping words according to a list such as <a href=""http://www.world-english.org/english500.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list</a> does not sound challenging but there are linguistic aspects, such as which words to stress the most in stripping, how about context?</p>
","java, parsing, nlp","<p>What it sounds like you are trying to do is remove the ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stop_words"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">stop words</a>"" from the text. You can find a <a href=""http://www.ranks.nl/resources/stopwords.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">list of English stopwords</a> at the link. Depending on how many stop words you use, it may be more efficient to create a <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">HashSet</a> of words,so that you can tell whether a word is a stop-word in constant-time (by using the <a href=""http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/api/java/util/HashSet.html#contains%28java.lang.Object%29"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">contains()</a> function), which would imply that filtering the entire text would take linear time in the number of words. This is such a simple operation that I doubt you will find some library to do it, but it shouldn't take long.</p>

<p>In terms of choosing which words to use... it really depends on what you are trying to do. If you are performing some sort of machine learning algorithm on the <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bag_of_words_model"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">bag of words model</a>, then you really have to try different selections of words and see which ones lead to the least validation error. In terms of the context, a lot of words really aren't needed. Anyone who speaks English well can tell you when you've dropped a ""the"" or ""a"" or ""an"". There may be common words that are important for certain disambiguation, but depending on your application, they may or may not be necessary. For example, if you want to know who did something, then eliminating ""he"", ""she"", etc. might be a problem, but if you only care about whether such-and-such an action occured and you don't really care who did it, then eliminating pronouns would be just fine.</p>

<p>If you're uncertain which one to go with, I would recommend starting with  <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NLTK</a>. The package is reasonably easy to use and has great documentation online, including <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/book"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a free book</a>.</p>

<p>You should be able to use NLTK to easily accomplish the NLP tasks you've listed, e.g. <a href=""http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch07.html#named-entity-recognition"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">named entity recognition (NER)</a>, <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2661778/tag-generation-from-a-text-content"">extracting tags for documents</a>, and <a href=""http://nltk.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/book/ch06.html#document-classification"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">document categorization</a>. </p>

<p>What the Alchemy people call <a href=""http://www.alchemyapi.com/api/scrape/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">structured data extraction</a> looks like it's just HTML scrapping that is robust against changes to the underlying HTML as long as the page still visually renders the same way.

<p>Edit: yes, I'm reasonably certain he was talking about the programming part of the job. Here's a bit more complete quote:</p>

<p>The problems of business administration in general and database management in particular are much too difficult for people who think in IBMerese, compounded by sloppy English.</p>

<p>About the use of language: it is impossible to sharpen a pencil with a blunt axe. It is equally vain to try to do it with ten blunt axes instead.</p>

<p>I certainly can't speak for Dijkstra, but I think it's impossible to cleanly separate the part where you're doing actual programming from the part where you're interacting with people. Just for example, even when you're working alone, it's crucial that you're able to understand (clearly and unambiguously) notes you wrote down about what to do, the nature of a bug, etc. A good command of English is necessary even when nobody else is involved at all (and, of course, that's unusual except on trivial tasks).</p>

Generating easy-to-remember random identifiers,"<p>As all developers do, we constantly deal with some kind of identifiers as part of our daily work. Most of the time, it's about bugs or support tickets. Our software, upon detecting a bug, creates a package that has a name formatted from a timestamp and a version number, which is a cheap way of creating reasonably unique identifiers to avoid mixing packages up. Example: ""<em>Bug Report 20101214 174856 6.4b2</em>"".</p>

<p>My brain just isn't that good at remembering numbers. What I would love to have is a simple way of <strong>generating alpha-numeric identifiers that are easy to remember</strong>.</p>

<p>It takes about 5 minutes to whip up an algorithm like the following in python, which produces halfway usable results:</p>

<pre><code>import random

vowels = 'aeiuy' # 0 is confusing
consonants = 'bcdfghjklmnpqrstvwxz'
numbers = '0123456789'

random.seed()

for i in range(30):
    chars = list()
    chars.append(random.choice(consonants))
    chars.append(random.choice(vowels))
    chars.append(random.choice(consonants + numbers))
    chars.append(random.choice(vowels))
    chars.append(random.choice(vowels))
    chars.append(random.choice(consonants))
    print ''.join(chars)

<p>The results look like this:</p>

<pre><code>re1ean
meseux
le1ayl
kuteef
neluaq
tyliyd
ki5ias
</code></pre>

<p>This is already quite good, but I feel it is still easy to forget how they are spelled exactly, so that if you walk over to a colleagues desk and want to look one of those up, there's still potential for difficulty.</p>

<p>I know of algorithms that perform trigram analysis on text (say you feed them a whole book in German) and that can generate strings that look and feel like German words and are thus easier to handle generally. This requires lots of data, though, and makes it slightly less suitable for embedding in an application just for this purpose.</p>

TDD and the Bayesian Spam Filter problem,"<p>It's well known that Bayesian classifiers are an effective way to filter spam. These can be fairly concise (our one is only a few hundred LoC) but all core code needs to be written up-front before you get any results at all.</p>

<p>However, the TDD approach mandates that only the minimum amount of code to pass a test can be written, so given the following method signature:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsSpam(string text)
</code></pre>

<p>And the following string of text, which is clearly spam:</p>

<pre><code>""Cheap generic viagra""
</code></pre>

<p>The minimum amount of code I could write is:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsSpam(string text)
{
    return text == ""Cheap generic viagra""
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now maybe I add another test message, e.g.</p>

<pre><code>""Online viagra pharmacy""
</code></pre>

<p>I could change the code to:</p>

<pre><code>bool IsSpam(string text)
{
    return text.Contains(""viagra"");
}
</code></pre>

<p>...and so on, and so on. Until at some point the code becomes a mess of string checks, regular expressions, etc. because we've <em>evolved</em> it instead of thinking about it and writing it in a different way from the start.</p>

<p>So how is TDD supposed to work with this type of situation where evolving the code from the simplest possible code to pass the test is not the right approach? (Particularly if it is known in advance that the best implementations cannot be trivially evolved).</p>

Python - letter frequency count and translation,"<p>I am using Python 3.1, but I can downgrade if needed.</p>

<p>I have an ASCII file containing a short story written in one of the languages the alphabet of which can be represented with upper and or lower ASCII. I wish to:</p>

<p>1) Detect an encoding to the best of my abilities, get some sort of confidence metric (would vary depending on the length of the file, right?)</p>

<p>2) Automatically translate the whole thing using some free online service or a library.</p>

<p>Additional question: What if the text is written in a language where it takes 2 or more bytes to represent one letter and the byte order mark is not there to help me?</p>

<p>Finally, how do I deal with punctuation and misc characters such as space? It will occur more frequently than some letters, right? How about the fact that punctuation and characters can be sometimes mixed - there might be two representations of a comma, two representations for what looks like an ""a"", etc.?</p>

<p>Yes, I have read <a href=""http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/Unicode.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the article by Joel Spolsky on Unicode</a>. Please help me with at least some of these items.</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>P.S. This is not a homework, but it is for self-educational purposes. I prefer using a letter frequency library that is open-source and readable as opposed to the one that is closed, efficient, but gets the job done well.</p>
","python, character-encoding, translation, nlp","<p>Essentially there are three main tasks to implement the described application:</p>

<ul>
<li>1a) Identify the character encoding of the input text</li>
<li>1b) Identify the language of the input text</li>
<li>2) Get the text translated the text, by way of one of the online services' API</li>
</ul>

<p>For 1a, you may want to take a look at <a href=""http://gizmojo.org/code/decodeh/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><strong>decodeh.py</strong></a>, aside from the script itself, it provides many very useful resources regarding character sets and encoding at large. <strong>CharDet</strong>, mentioned in other answer also seems to be worthy of consideration.</p>

<p>Once the character encoding is known, as you suggest, you may solve 1b) by calculating the character frequency profile of the text, and matching it with known frequencies.  While simple, this approach typically provide a decent precision ratio, although it may be weak on shorter texts and also on texts which follow particular patterns; for example a text in French with many references to units in the metric system will have an unusually high proportion of the letters M, K and C.</p>

<p>A complementary and very similar approach, use bi-grams (sequences of two letters) and tri-grams (three letters) and the corresponding tables of frequency distribution references in various languages.</p>

<p>Other language detection methods involve tokenizing the text, i.e. considering the words within the text.  NLP resources include tables with the most used words in various languages. Such words are typically articles, possessive adjectives, adverbs and the like.</p>

<p>An alternative solution to the language detection is to rely on the online translation service to figure this out for us.  What is important is to supply the translation service with text in a character encoding it understands, providing it the language may be superfluous.</p>

<p>Finally, as many practical NLP applications, you may decide to implement multiple solutions.  By using a strategy design pattern, one can apply several filters/classifiers/steps in a particular order, and exit this logic at different points depending on the situation.  For example, if a simple character/bigram frequency matches the text to English (with a small deviation), one may just stop there.  Otherwise, if the guessed language is French or German, perform another test, etc. etc.</p>

Elegant command-parsing in an OOP-based text game,"<p>I'm playing with writing a MUD/text adventure (please don't laugh) in Ruby.  Can anyone give me any pointers towards   an elegant, oop-based solution to parsing input text?  </p>

<p>We're talking about nothing more complex than ""put wand on table"", here.  But everything needs to be soft; I want to extend the command set painlessly, later.  </p>

<p>My current thoughts, slightly simplified:  </p>

<ol>
<li><p>Each item class (box, table, room, player) knows how to recognise a command that  'belongs' to it.</p></li>
<li><p>The game class understands a sort of a domain-specific language involving actions such as ""move object X inside object Y"", ""show description of object X"", etc.  </p></li>
<li><p>The game class asks each item in the room if it recognises the input command.  First to say yes wins.  </p></li>
<li><p>It then passes control to a method in the item class that handles the command.  This method rephrases the command in the DSL, passes it back to the game object to make it happen.</p></li>

justwords = justwords.encode('utf-8')
true_lang =  str(guess_language.guessLanguage(justwords))

</code></pre>

<p>Edit: THanks guys for your help. This is an update of the problem.</p>

<p>I am trying to ""guess"" the language of this: <strong><a href=""http://feeds.feedburner.com/nchild"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://feeds.feedburner.com/nchild</a></strong></p>

<p>Basically, in Python, I get the htmlSource. Then, I strip the tags using BeautifulSoup.  Then, I pass it to the library to get the language. If I do not do encode('utf-8'), then ASCII-errors will come up. So , this is a must.</p>

<pre><code>soup = BeautifulStoneSoup(htmlSource)
justwords = ''.join(soup.findAll(text=True))
justwords = justwords.encode('utf-8')
true_lang =  str(guess_language.guessLanguage(justwords))
</code></pre>
","python, unicode, encoding, nlp","<p>Looking at the main page, it says """"""Detects over 60 languages; Greek (el), Korean (ko), Japanese (ja), Chinese (zh) and all the languages listed in the trigrams directory. """"""</p>

<p>It doesn't use trigrams for those 4 languages; it relies on what script blocks are present in the input text. Looking at the source code:</p>

<pre><code>if ""Katakana"" in scripts or ""Hiragana"" in scripts or ""Katakana Phonetic Extensions"" in scripts:
    return ""ja""

if ""CJK Unified Ideographs"" in scripts or ""Bopomofo"" in scripts \
        or ""Bopomofo Extended"" in scripts or ""KangXi Radicals"" in scripts:
    return ""zh""
</code></pre>

<p>For a script name like Katakana or Hiragana to appear in <code>scripts</code>, such characters must comprise 40% or more of the input text (after normalisation which removes non-alphabetic characters etc). It may be possible that some Japanese text needs a threshold of less than 40%. HOWEVER if that was the problem with your text, I would expect it to have more than 40% kanji (CJK Unified Ideographs) and thus should return ""zh"" (Chinese).</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong> after some experimentation, including inserting a print statement to show what script blocks were detected with what percentages:</p>

<p>A presumably typical news item from the Asahi newspaper website:</p>

<pre><code> 49.3 Hiragana
  8.7 Katakana
 42.0 CJK Unified Ideographs
result ja
</code></pre>

<p>A presumably atypical ditto:</p>

<pre><code> 35.9 Hiragana
 49.2 CJK Unified Ideographs
 13.3 Katakana
  1.6 Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms
result zh
</code></pre>

<p>(Looks like it might be a good idea to base the test on the total (Hiragana + Katakana) content)</p>

<p>Result of shoving the raw front page (XML, HTML, everything) through the machinery:</p>

<pre><code>  2.4 Hiragana
  6.1 CJK Unified Ideographs
  0.1 Halfwidth and Fullwidth Forms
  3.7 Katakana
 87.7 Basic Latin
result ca
</code></pre>

<p>The high percentage of Basic Latin is of course due to the markup. I haven't investigated what made it choose ""ca"" (Catalan) over any other language which uses Basic Latin, including English. However the gobbledegook that you printed doesn't show any sign of including markup.</p>

<p><strong>End of update</strong></p>

<p><strong>Update 2</strong></p>

<p>Here's an example (2 headlines and next 4 paragraphs from <a href=""http://www2.toyota.co.jp/jp/news/10/01/nt10_0102.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this link</a>) where about 83% of the characters are East Asian and the rest are Basic Latin but the result is <strong>en</strong> (English).</p>

<pre><code> 29.6 Hiragana
 18.5 Katakana
 34.9 CJK Unified Ideographs
 16.9 Basic Latin
result en
</code></pre>

<p>The Basic Latin Characters are caused by the use of the English names of organisations etc in the text. The Japanese rule fails because neither Katakana nor Hiragana score 40% (together they score 48.1%). The Chinese rule fails because CJK Unified Ideographs scores less than 40%. So the 83.1% East Asian characters are ignored, and the result is decided by the 16.9% minority. These ""<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotten_and_pocket_boroughs"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">rotten borough</a>"" rules need some reform. In generality, it could be expressed like:</p>

<p>If (total of script blocks used by only language X) >= X-specific threshold, then select language X.</p>

<p>As suggested above, Hiragana + Katakana >= 40% will probably do the trick for Japanese. A similar rule may well be needed for Korean.</p>

<p>Your gobbledegook did actually contain a few characters of markup (I didn't scroll far enough to the right to see it) but certainly not enough to depress all the East Asian scores below 40%. So we're still waiting to see what your actual input is and how you got it from where.</p>

<p><strong>End of update2</strong></p>

<p>To aid with diagnosis of your problem, please don't print gobbledegook; use</p>

<pre><code>print repr(justwords)
</code></pre>

<p>That way anyone who is interested in actually doing debugging has got something to work on. It would help if you gave the URL of the webpage, and showed the Python code that you used to get your unicode <code>justwords</code>. Please edit your answer to show those 3 pieces of information.</p>

<p><strong>Update 3</strong> Thanks for the URL. Visual inspection indicates that the language is overwhelmingly Chinese. What gave you the impression that it is Japanese?</p>

<p>Semithanks for supplying some of your code. To avoid your correspondents having to do your work for you, and to avoid misunderstandings due to guessing, you should always supply (without being asked) a self-contained script that will reproduce your problem. Note that you say you got ""ASCII errors"" (no exact error message! no traceback!) if you didn't do .encode('utf8') -- my code (see below) doesn't have this problem.</p>

<p>No thanks for not supplying the result of <code>print repr(justwords)</code> (even after being asked). Inspecting what intermediate data has been created is a very elementary and very effective debugging technique. This is something you should always do before asking a question. Armed with this knowledge you can ask a better question.</p>

<p>Using this code:</p>

<pre><code># coding: ascii
import sys
sys.path.append(r""C:\junk\wotlang\guess-language\guess_language"")
import guess_language
URL = ""http://feeds.feedburner.com/nchild""
from BeautifulSoup import BeautifulStoneSoup
from pprint import pprint as pp
import urllib2
htmlSource = urllib2.urlopen(URL).read()
soup = BeautifulStoneSoup(htmlSource)
fall = soup.findAll(text=True)
# pp(fall)
justwords = ''.join(fall)
# justwords = justwords.encode('utf-8')
result = guess_language.guessLanguage(justwords)
print ""result"", result
</code></pre>

<p>I got these results:</p>

<pre><code> 29.0 CJK Unified Ideographs
  0.0 Extended Latin
  0.1 Katakana
 70.9 Basic Latin
result en
</code></pre>

<p>Note that the URL content is not static; about an hour later I got:</p>

<pre><code> 27.9 CJK Unified Ideographs
  0.0 Extended Latin
  0.1 Katakana
 72.0 Basic Latin
</code></pre>

<p>The statistics were obtained by fiddling around line 361 of <code>guess_language.py</code> so that it reads:</p>

<pre><code>for key, value in run_types.items():
    pct = (value*100.0) / totalCount # line changed so that pct is a float
    print ""%5.1f %s"" % (pct, key) # line inserted
    if pct &gt;=40:
        relevant_runs.append(key)
</code></pre>

<p>The statistics are symptomatic of Chinese with lots of HTML/XML/Javascript stuff (see previous example); this is confirmed by looking at the output of the pretty-print obtained by un-commenting <code>pp(fall)</code> -- lots of stuff like:</p>

<p>The high-level approach is as follows:  for a given query, come up with possible correction candidates (words in the query log within a certain edit distance) of each unigram and bigram, then perform a modified Viterbi search to find the most likely sequence of candidates given bigram frequencies.  Repeat this process until the sequence is of maximum probability.</p>

<p>The modification to the Viterbi search is such that if two adjacent words are both found in a trusted lexicon, at most one can be corrected.  This is especially important for avoiding correction of properly-spelled single-word queries to words of higher frequency.</p>

<p>My question is where to find such a lexicon.  It should be in English and contain proper nouns (first/last names, places, brand names, etc) likely to show up in search queries as well as common and uncommon English words.  Even a push in the right direction would be useful.</p>

What a single sentence consist of? How to name it?,"<p>I'm designing architecture of a text parser. Example sentence: <code>Content here, content here.</code></p>

<p>Whole sentence is a... sentence, that's obvious. <code>The</code>, <code>quick</code> etc are words; <code>,</code> and  <code>.</code> are punctuation marks. But what are words and punctuation marks all together  in general? Are they just symbols? I simply don't know how to name what a single sentence consists of in the most reasonable abstract way (because one may write it consists of letters/vowels etc).</p>

<p>Thanks for any help :)</p>
","oop, nlp, abstraction, linguistics","<p>What you're doing is technically lexical analysis (""lexing""), which takes a sequence of input symbols and generates a series of tokens or lexemes. So word, punctuation and white-space are all tokens.</p>

<p>In (E)BNF terms, lexemes or tokens are synonymous with ""terminal symbols"". If you think of the set of parsing rules as a tree the terminal symbols are the leaves of the tree.</p>

<p>So what's the atom of your input? Is it a word or a sentence? If it's words (and white-space) then a sentence is more akin to a parsing rule. In fact the term ""sentence"" can itself be misleading. It's not uncommon to refer to the entire input sequence as a sentence.</p>

<p>A semi-common term for a sequence of non-white-space characters is a ""textrun"".</p>

","nlp, semantic-markup, nltk, semantic-analysis","<p>The problem you're referring to is known as the imbalance problem. Many machine learning algorithms perform badly when confronted with imbalanced training data, i.e. when the instances of one class heavily outnumber those of the other class. Read <a href=""http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.58.7757&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a> to get a good overview of the problem and how to approach it. For techniques like naive bayes or decision trees it is always a good idea to balance your data somehow, e.g. by random oversampling (explained in the references paper). I disagree with mjv's suggestion to have a training set match the proportions in the real world. This may be appropriate in some cases but I'm quite confident it's not in your setting. For a classification problem like the one you describe, the more the sizes of the class sets differ, the more most ML algorithms will have problems discriminating the classes properly. However, you can always use the information about which class is the largest in reality by taking it as a fallback such that when the classifier's confidence for a particular instance is low or this instance couldn't be classified at all, you would assign it the largest class. </p>

<p>One further remark: finding the positivity/negativity/neutrality in Twitter messages seems to me to be a question of degree. As such, it may be viewes as a regression rather than a classification problem, i.e. instead of a three class scheme you perhaps may want calculate a score which tells you <em>how</em> positive/negative the message is. </p>

Matching substrings from a dictionary to other string: suggestions?,"<p>Hellow Stack Overflow people. I'd like some suggestions regarding the following problem. I am using Java.</p>

<p>I have an array #1 with a number of Strings. For example, two of the strings might be: ""An apple fell on Newton's head"" and ""Apples grow on trees"".</p>

<p>On the other side, I have another array #2 with terms like (Fruits => Apple, Orange, Peach; Items => Pen, Book; ...). I'd call this array my ""dictionary"".</p>

<p>By comparing items from one array to the other, I need to see in which ""category"" the items from #1 fall into from #2. E.g. Both from #1 would fall under ""Fruits"".</p>

<p>My most important consideration is speed. I need to do those operations fast. A structure allowing constant time retrieval would be good.</p>

<p>I considered a Hashset with the contains() method, but it doesn't allow substrings. I also tried running regex like (apple|orange|peach|...etc) with case insensitive flag on, but I read that it will not be fast when the terms increase in number (minimum 200 to be expected). Finally, I searched, and am considering using an ArrayList with indexOf() but I don't know about its performance. I also need to know which of the terms actually matched, so in this case, it would be ""Apple"".</p>

Training Hidden Markov Models without Tagged Corpus Data,"<p>For a linguistics course we implemented Part of Speech (POS) tagging using a hidden markov model, where the hidden variables were the parts of speech.

Calculating context-sensitive text correlation,"<p>Suppose I want to match address records (or person names or whatever) against each other to merge records that are most likely referring to the same address.

""West Lawnmower Drive 54 A"" is probably the same as ""W. Lawn Mower Dr. 54A"" but different from ""East Lawnmower Drive 54 A"".</p>

<p>I think this is a tricky one - perhaps there are some well-known algorithms out there?</p>
","algorithm, string, text, nlp","<p>A good <em>baseline</em>, probably an impractical one in terms of its relatively high computational cost and more importantly its production of many false positive, would be generic string distance algorithms such as</p>

<ul>
<li>tokenize the input, i.e. see the input as an array of words rather than a string</li>
<li>tokenization should also keep the line number info</li>
<li>normalize the input with the use of a short dictionary of common substituions (such as ""dr"" at the end of a line = ""drive"", ""Jack"" = ""John"", ""Bill"" = ""William""..., ""W."" at the begining of a line is ""West"" etc.</li>
<li>Identify (a bit like tagging, as in POS tagging) the nature of some entities (for example ZIP Code, and Extended ZIP code, and also city</li>
<li>Identify (lookup) some of these entities (for example a relative short database table can include all the Cities / town in the targeted area</li>
<li>Identify (lookup) some domain-related entities  (if all/many of the address deal with say folks in the legal profession, a lookup of law firm names or of federal buildings may be of help.</li>
<li>Generally, put more weight on tokens that come from the last line of the address</li>
<li>Put more (or less) weight on tokens with a particular entity type (ex: ""Drive"", ""Street"", ""Court"" should with much less than the tokens which precede them.</li>
<li>Consider a modified <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soundex"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>SOUNDEX</strong></a> algorithm to help with normalization of </li>
</ul>

<p>With the above in mind, implement <strong><em>a rule-based evaluator</em></strong>.  Tentatively, the rules could be implemented as visitors to a tree/array-like structure where the input is parsed initially (<a href=""http://sourcemaking.com/design_patterns/visitor"" rel=""noreferrer"">Visitor design pattern</a>).<br>
The advantage of the rule-based framework, is that each heuristic is in its own function and rules can be prioritized, i.e. placing some rules early in the chain, allowing to abort the evaluation early, with some strong heuristics  (eg: different City => Correlation = 0, level of confidence = 95% etc...).</p>

<p>An important consideration with search for correlations is the <strong>need to <em>a priori</em> compare every single item (here address) with every other item</strong>, hence requiring as many as <code>1/2 n^2</code> item-level comparisons.  Because of this, it may be useful to store the reference items in a way where they are pre-processed (parsed, normalized...) and also to maybe have a <strong>digest/key of sort</strong> that can be used as [very rough] indicator of a possible correlation  (for example a key made of the 5 digit ZIP-Code followed by the SOUNDEX value of the ""primary"" name). </p>

","java, nlp","<p>A part-of-speech tagger assigns labels to the words in the input text. For example, the popular Penn Treebank tagset has some 40 labels, such as ""plural noun"", ""comparative adjective"", ""past tense verb"", etc. The tagger also resolves some ambiguity. For example, many English word forms can be either nouns or verbs, but in the context of other words, their part of speech is unambiguous.
So, having annotated your text with POS tags you can answer questions like: how many nouns do I have?, how many sentences do not contain a verb?, etc.</p>

<p>For a chatbot, you obviously need much more than that. You need to figure out the subjects and objects in the text, and which verb (predicate) they attach to; you need to resolve anaphors (which individual does a <em>he</em> or <em>she</em> point to), what is the scope of negation and quantifiers (e.g. <em>every</em>, <em>more than 3</em>), etc.</p>

<p>Ideally, you need to map you input text into some logical representation (such as first-order logic), which would let you bring in reasoning to determine if two sentences are equivalent in meaning, or in an entailment relationship, etc.</p>

Algorithms to detect phrases and keywords from text,"<p>I have around 100 megabytes of text, without any markup, divided to approximately 10,000 entries. I would like to automatically generate a 'tag' list. The problem is that there are word groups (i.e. phrases) that only make sense when they are grouped together.</p>

<p>If I just count the words, I get a large number of really common words (is, the, for, in, am, etc.). I have counted the words and the number of other words that are before and after it, but now I really cannot figure out what to do next The information relating to the 2 and 3 word phrases is present, but how do I extract this data?</p>
","algorithm, nlp, text-processing","<p>Before anything, <strong>try to preserve the info about ""boundaries"" which comes in the input text.</strong><br>
(if such info has not readily be lost, your question implies that maybe the tokenization has readily been done)<br>
During the tokenization (word parsing, in this case) process, look for patterns that may define <strong>expression boundaries</strong> (such as punctuation, particularly periods, and also multiple LF/CR separation,  use these.  Also words like ""the"", can often be used as boundaries.   Such expression boundaries are typically ""negative"", in a sense that they separate two token instances which are sure to <em>not</em> be included in the same expression.  A few positive boundaries are quotes, particularly double quotes.   This type of info may be useful to filter-out some of the n-grams (see next paragraph).  Also word sequencces such as ""for example"" or ""in lieu of"" or ""need to"" can be used as expression boundaries as well (but using such info is edging on using ""priors"" which I discuss later).</p>

<p><em>Without using external data</em> (other than the input text), you can have a relative success with this by running statistics on <strong>the text's digrams and trigrams</strong> (sequence of 2 and 3 consecutive words).  Then [most] the sequences with a significant (*) number of instances will likely be the type of ""expression/phrases"" you are looking for.<br>
This somewhat crude method will yield a few false positive, but on the whole may be workable.  Having filtered the n-grams known to cross ""boundaries"" as hinted in the first paragraph, may help significantly because in natural languages sentence ending and sentence starts tend to draw from a limited subset of the message space and hence produce combinations of token that may appear to be statistically well represented, but which are typically not semantically related. </p>

<p><strong>Better methods</strong> (possibly more expensive, processing-wise, and design/investment-wise), will make the use of extra ""priors"" relevant to the domain and/or national languages of the input text. </p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Part-of-speech_tagging"" rel=""noreferrer""><strong>POS (Part-Of-Speech) tagging</strong></a> is quite useful, in several ways (provides additional, more objective expression boundaries, and also ""noise"" words classes, for example all articles, even when used in the context of entities are typically of little in tag clouds such that the OP wants to produce.</li>
<li><strong>Dictionaries, lexicons</strong> and the like can be quite useful too.  In particular, these which identify ""entities"" (aka instances in <a href=""http://wordnet.princeton.edu"" rel=""noreferrer"">WordNet</a> lingo) and their alternative forms.  Entities are very important for tag clouds (though they are not the only class of words found in them), and by identifying them, it is also possible to normalize them  (the many different expressions which can be used for say,""Senator T. Kennedy""), hence eliminate duplicates, but also increase the frequency of the underlying entities.</li>
<li>if the corpus is structured as a document collection, it may be useful to use various tricks related to the TF (Term Frequency) and IDF (Inverse Document Frequency)</li>

Natural Language CFG builder Algorithm,"<p>I am working in a natural language processing project. It aims to build libraries for Arabic language. We working on a POS tagger and now I am thinking in grammar phase. Since Arabic language and many others have complicated grammar, so it is very hard to build their context free grammar (CFG). For this reason I had an idea for an algorithm to build a CFG (with probability PCFG) for any language from a tagger corpora using unsupervised learning. To explain the algorithm suppose I have these three tagged statements as an input:
1- Verb Noun
2- Verb Noun Subject
3- Verb Noun Subject adverb
The algorithm gives:
1) A--> Verb Noun
2) B-->A Subject
3) C-->B adverb.<br/>
We repeat this methodology for each statement such that we can finish with a specific PCFG. The main power of the algorithm lies beyond the fact of seeing the whole statement, so the probabilities can be conditional and they are specific. After that CKY algorithm can be applied to choose the best tree for new statements using probabilities.
Do you expect that this algorithm is good or not and does it worth to continue improving it.</p>

Different levels in speech recognition software,"<p>There are phonetic level, syntactic level, semantic level, phonological level, acoustic level,
linguistic level, language level. </p>

<p>Are there any other levels? </p>

<p>What's the order from the bottom up?</p>

<p>And what are they really about?</p>
","nlp, speech-recognition","<p>Language admits a lot of diversity, but it also obeys a lot of rules (though often loose ones, with tons of exceptions).  So in a particular language, certain sounds are more likely to follow other sounds, certain words are more likely to follow others, and so on. The levels are basically the level of modeling.  </p>

<p>Acoustic level is trying to determine which acoustic signals are useful for distinguishing human speech.  It tries to answer questions like, ""Is this background noise or a speech sound?""</p>

<p>Phonological level is based on what sounds are most likely to combine together when it is trying to reconstruct an acoustic signal into a sequence of phonemes.  I think this is essentially the same as the phonetic level.</p>

<p>The language level determines what kind of accent the user has, the dialect, etc.</p>

<p>At the syntactic level, you're looking at which words are likely to appear together based on the syntax of the sentence.  This gets rid of words that it would have guessed based on the phonological level but would construct ungrammatical sentences.</p>

<p>The linguistic level as I understand it is more a matter of picking the right word (for example, which homonym <em>our</em> versus <em>hour</em>) based on the context. </p>

<p>At the semantic level, it attempts to model the meaning of the sentence and get rid of things that don't conform to the grammatical relations of verbs and prepositions.  For example, the verb disappear takes no direct object, so if there is something in that semantic slot, there probably is an error.</p>

<p>The order will depend on the application really, some of them may be collapsed into each other, some may not be used at all.  A conceptual hierarchy that makes sense to me is acoustic &lt; phonological = phonetic &lt; language &lt; syntactic &lt; linguistic &lt; semantic.</p>

Very basic English grammar parser,"<p>I'm writing a very basic parser(mostly just to better understand how they work) that takes a user's input of a select few words, detects whether the sentence structure is OK or Not OK, and outputs the result. The grammar is:</p>

<p>Sentence:
Noun Verb</p>

<p>Article Sentence</p>

<p>Sentence Conjunction Sentence</p>

<p>Conjunction:
""and""
""or""
""but""</p>

<p>Noun:
""birds""
""fish""
""C++""</p>

<p>Verb:
""rules""
""fly""
""swim""</p>

<p>Article:
""the""</p>

<p>Writing the grammar was simple. It's implementing the code that is giving me some trouble. My psuedocode for it is:</p>

<pre><code>main()
get user input (string words;)
while loop (cin &gt;&gt; words)
call sentence()
end main()

sentence()
call noun()
if noun() call verb() (if verb is true return ""OK"" ???)(else ""not ok""???)
else if not noun() call article()
                if article() call sentence() (if sentence is true ""OK""???)(else ""not""?)
else if not noun() call conjunction()
                   if sentence() conjunction() sentence() - no idea how to implement
                                                             return ""OK""
else ""not ok""
</code></pre>

<p>So there is my extremely sloppy psuedo code. I have a few questions on implementing it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For the word functions (noun, verb, etc.) how should I go about checking if they are true? (as in checking if the user's input has birds, fish, fly, swim, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>How should I handle the conjunction call and the output?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I handle the output from the main function or the call functions?</p></li>
<li><p>None of the above questions matter if my psuedo code is completely wrong. Is there anything wrong with the basics?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As an added note, I'm on a Chapter 6 exercise of Programming: Practice and Principles Using C++ so I'd prefer to use language syntax that I've already learned, so anything that falls into the category of advanced programming probably isn't very helpful. (The exercise specifically says not to use tokens, so count those out.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Last Edit: In the book's public group I asked the same question and Bjarne Stroustrup commented back saying he put the exercise solution online. He basically had the input read into the sentence function and used if statements to return true or false. However, he didn't use articles so mine was much more complex. I guess if I've learned anything from this exercise its that when dealing with a lot of user input, tokenization is key (from what I know so far.) Here is my code for now. I may go back to it later because it is still very buggy and basically only returns if the sentence is OK and can't handle things like (noun, conjunction, sentence), but for now I'm moving on.</p>

Produce a sentence from a grammar with a given number of terminals,"<p>Say you've got a toy grammar, like: <em>(updated so the output looks more natural)</em></p>

<pre><code>S -&gt; ${NP} ${VP} | ${S} and ${S} | ${S}, after which ${S}

NP -&gt; the ${N} | the ${A} ${N} | the ${A} ${A} ${N}

VP -&gt; ${V} ${NP}

N -&gt; dog | fish | bird | wizard

V -&gt; kicks | meets | marries

A -&gt; red | striped | spotted
</code></pre>

<p>e.g., ""the dog kicks the red wizard"", ""the bird meets the spotted fish or the wizard marries the striped dog""</p>

<p>How can you produce a sentence from this grammar according to the constraint that it must contain a total of <em>n</em> Vs + As + Ns. Given an integer the sentence must contain that many terminals. (note of course in this grammar the minimum possible <em>n</em> is 3).</p>
","algorithm, language-agnostic, parsing, nlp, grammar","<p>The following Python code will generate a random sentence with the given number of terminals.
It works by counting the number of ways to produce a sentence of a given length, generating a large random number, and computing the indicated sentence.
The count is done recursively, with memoization.
An empty right hand side produces 1 sentence if n is 0 and 0 sentences otherwise.
To count the number of sentences produced by a nonempty right hand side, sum over i, the number of terminals used by the first symbol in the right hand side.
For each i, multiply the number of possibilities for the rest of the right hand side by the number of possibilities for the first symbol.
If the first symbol is a terminal, there is 1 possibility if i is 1 and 0 otherwise.
If the first symbol is a nonterminal, sum the possibilities over each alternative.
To avoid infinite loops, we have to be careful to prune the recursive calls when a quantity is 0.
This may still loop infinitely if the grammar has infinitely many derivations of one sentence.
For example, in the grammar</p>

<pre><code>S -&gt; S S
S -&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>there are infinitely many derivations of the empty sentence: S => , S => S S => , S => S S => S S S => , etc.
The code to find a particular sentence is a straightforward modification of the code to count them.
This code is reasonably efficient, generating 100 sentences with 100 terminals each in less than a second.</p>

Appropriate article (a/an) in String.Format,"<p>I'm looking for a culturally-sensitive way to properly insert a noun into a sentence while using the appropriate article (a/an). It could use String.Format, or possibly something else if the appropriate way to do this exists elsewhere.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<p>Base Sentence: ""You are looking at a/an {0}""</p>

<p>This should format to: ""You are looking at a carrot"" or ""You are looking at an egg.""</p>

<p>I'm currently doing this by manually checking the first character of the word to be inserted and then manually inserting ""a"" or ""an."" But I'm concerned that this might limit me when the application is localized to other languages.</p>

<p>Is there a best practice for approaching this problem?</p>

<p>RESOLUTION: It appears that the problem is complicated to the point that there does not exist a utility or framework to solve this problem in the way I originally phrased.

Parsing expressions with an undefined number of arguments,"<p>I'm trying to parse a string in a self-made language into a sort of tree, e.g.:</p>

<pre><code># a * b1 b2 -&gt; c * d1 d2 -&gt; e # f1 f2 * g
</code></pre>

<p>should result in:</p>

<pre><code># a
  * b1 b2
    -&gt; c
  * d1 d2
    -&gt; e
# f1 f2
  * g
</code></pre>

<p>#, * and -> are symbols. a, b1, etc. are texts.</p>

<p>Since the moment I know only rpn method to evaluate expressions, and my current solution is as follows. If I allow only a single text token after each symbol I can easily convert expression first into RPN notation (b = b1 b2; d = d1 d2; f = f1 f2) and parse it from here:</p>

<p>a b c -> * d e -> * # f g * #</p>

<p>However, merging text tokens and whatever else comes seems to be problematic. My idea was to create marker tokens (M), so RPN looks like:</p>

<p>a M b2 b1 M c -> * M d2 d1 M e -> * # f2 f1 M g * #</p>

<p>which is also parseable and seems to solve the problem.</p>

<p>That said:</p>

<ol>
<li>Does anyone have experience with something like that and can say it is or it is not a viable solution for the future?</li>
<li>Are there better methods for parsing expressions with undefined arity of operators?</li>
<li>Can you point me at some good resources?</li>
</ol>

<p>Note. Yes, I know this example very much resembles Lisp prefix notation and maybe the way to go would be to add some brackets, but I don't have any experience here. However, the source text must not contain any artificial brackets and also I'm not sure what to do about potential infix mixins like # a * b -> [if value1 =  value2] c -> d.</p>

<p>Thanks for any help.</p>

<p>EDIT: It seems that what I'm looking for are sources on postfix notation with a variable number of arguments.</p>
","algorithm, parsing, nlp, rpn","<p><s>I couldn't fully understand your question, but it seems what you want is a grammar definition and a parser generator. I suggest you take a look at <a href=""http://www.antlr.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">ANTLR</a>, it should be pretty straightforward with it to define a grammar for either your original syntax or the RPN.</s></p>
<p><strong>Edit:</strong> (After exercising self-criticism, and making some effort to understand the question details.) Actually, the language grammar is unclear from your example. However, it seems to me, that the advantages of the prefix/postfix notations (i.e. that you need neither parentheses nor a precedence-aware parser) stem from the fact that you <em>know the number of arguments</em> every time you encounter an operator, therefore you know exactly how many elements to read (for prefix notation) or to pop from the stack (for postfix notation). OTOH, I beleive that having operators which can have variable number of arguments makes prefix/postfix notations not simply difficult to parse but outright ambiguous.  Take the following expression for example:</p>
<pre><code># a * b c d
</code></pre>
<p>Which of the following three is the canonical form?</p>
<ol>
<li><h1>(a, *(b, c, d))</h1>
</li>
<li><h1>(a, *(b, c), d)</h1>
</li>
<li><h1>(a, *(b), c, d)</h1>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Without knowing more about the operators, it is impossible to tell. Of course you could define some sort of greedyness of the operators, e.g. * is greedier than #, so it gobbles up all the arguments. But this would beat the purpose of a prefix notation, because you simply wouldn't be able to write down the second variant from the above three; not without additinonal syntactic elements.</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, it is probably not by sheer chance that none of the programming languages I know support <em>operators</em> with a variable number of arguments, only <em>functions/procedures</em>.</p>
