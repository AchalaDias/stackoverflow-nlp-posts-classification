semantic similarity for mix of languages,"<p>I have a database of several thousands of utterances. Each record (utterance) is a text representing a problem description, which a user has submitted to a service desk. Sometimes also the service desk agent's response is included. The language is highly technical, and it contains three types of tokens:</p>
<ol>
<li>words and phrases in Language 1 (e.g. English)</li>
<li>words and phrases in Language 2 (e.g. French, Norwegian, or Italian)</li>
<li>machine-generated output (e.g. listing of files using unix command ls -la)</li>
</ol>
<p>These languages are densely mixed. I often see that in one conversation, a sentence in Language 1 is followed by Language 2. So it is impossible to divide the data into two separate sets, corresponding to utterances in two languages.</p>
<p>The task is to find similarities between the records (problem descriptions). The purpose of this exercise is to understand whether some bugs submitted by users are similar to each other.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What is the most effective way to proceed in such a situation?</strong></p>
<p>In particular, the problem lies in the fact that the words come from two different corpora (corpuses), while in addition, some technical words (like filenames, OS paths, or application names) will not be found in any of those.</p>
<p>So the difficulty is in finding similarities between words and utterances in situation when the mix of words does not correspond to known corpus, but rather a mix of corpora.</p>

Why are weight matrices shared between embedding layers in &#39;Attention is All You Need&#39; paper?,"<p>I am using the Transformer module in pytorch from the paper &quot;Attention is All You Need&quot;. On page 5, the authors state that</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In our model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation, similar to [30]. (page 5)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The embedding layer, at least in pytorch, is a learnable tensor whose columns are the embedding vectors corresponding to each word. My confusion stems from the fact that in the paper, the Transformer learns a translation task between languages (i.e. English to German). <strong>Thus, how could the embedding weights be shared for the English and German embedding vectors?</strong></p>
<p><strong>In addition, how could the weights be shared between the output embedding (which goes from word index to embedding vector) and the linear layer (which goes from embedding vector to word probabilities)?</strong> As far as I can tell there is no constraint requiring the embedding tensor must be orthogonal (so that its inverse is its transpose).</p>

Natural language processing - Tamil,"<p>I'm building a voice-based system where the end users speak in Tamil, but they may include English keywords (e.g., &quot;WiFi&quot;, &quot;OTP&quot;, &quot;camera&quot;) or numerical values (e.g., &quot;2024&quot;, &quot;1234&quot;) in their speech.</p>
<p>I'm planning to use AI4Bharat's Speech-to-Text model because it is well-trained for Indian languages and is free and open-source. The output from the ASR model is in pure Tamil script (e.g., &quot;வைஃபை&quot; for &quot;WiFi&quot;).</p>
<p>✅ My Current Approach:
Use AI4Bharat to transcribe Tamil speech to text.</p>
<p>Tokenize the Tamil output.</p>
<p>Check for certain target English words or numbers.</p>
<p>Replace or trigger an action when these are detected.</p>
<p>🤔 My Question:
Is this a good approach for reliably detecting specific English words or numerical values within Tamil speech?</p>
<p>Are there better or more robust free and long-term alternatives or enhancements to this method?</p>
<p>Any suggestions for improving accuracy (e.g., handling Tamil transliterations like &quot;வைஃபை&quot; for &quot;WiFi&quot;)?</p>
<p>🔧 Constraints:
It must be free of cost.</p>
<p>It should work reliably for the long term (no paid APIs or licenses).</p>
<p>Should work offline or with minimal dependencies if possible.</p>

Word frequency algorithm for natural language processing,"<p>Without getting a degree in information retrieval, I'd like to know if there exists any algorithms for counting the frequency that words occur in a given body of text.

<p>What I'd like:</p>

<ul>

<li>preserve proper nouns</li>
<li>ignore hyphenation, except for soft kind</li>

"How to handle German language specific characters like (&#228;, &#246;, &#252;, &#223;) while tokenizing using GPT2Tokenizer?","<p>I am working with German Texts, where I need to tokenize texts using GPT2Tokenizer.</p>
<p>To tokenize the text, I wrote the implementation as follows:</p>
<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>from transformers import GPT2Tokenizer

text = &quot;zügiger Transport des ABCD stabilen Kindes in die Notaufnahme UKA&quot;
text = text.encode(&quot;utf-8&quot;).decode(&quot;utf-8&quot;)  # Re-encode to fix encoding issues

# Load GPT-2 tokenizer
tokenizer = GPT2Tokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;gpt2&quot;)

# Tokenize the text
tokens = tokenizer.tokenize(text)

print(tokens)  # Should properly tokenize &quot;zügiger&quot; instead of splitting &quot;ü&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>Now, when I execute this code snippet I get output as follows:</p>
<pre><code>['z', 'Ã¼', 'g', 'iger', 'ĠTransport', 'Ġdes', 'ĠABC', 'D', 'Ġstabil', 'en', 'ĠKind', 'es', 'Ġin', 'Ġdie', 'ĠNot', 'au', 'fn', 'ah', 'me', 'ĠUK', 'A']
</code></pre>
<p>After a bit of analysis, I have found that all German language specific characters are mis-decoded as Latin-1 see the table below.</p>
<pre class=""lang-markdown prettyprint-override""><code>| Character | UTF-8 Bytes | Misdecoded as Latin-1 | Resulting String |

OpenNLP POSTaggerME and ChunkerME synergy,"<p>I'm trying to use the OpenNLP chunking API to chunk a portuguese sentence. So, first I tokenized a sentence using <a href=""https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.5.3/manual/opennlp.html#tools.tokenizer.api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">TokenizerME</a>, then I tagged it with <a href=""https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.5.3/manual/opennlp.html#tools.postagger.tagging.api"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">POSTaggerME</a>. For both I used the ready-made models provided by the project <a href=""https://opennlp.apache.org/models.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>.</p>
<p>For the sentence “Ivo viu a uva”, POSTaggerME returns the tags [PROPN, VERB, DET, NOUN]. The model seems to be using the <a href=""https://universaldependencies.org/u/pos/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">UD POS Tags</a>.</p>
<p>As there is no ready-made model for ChunkerME in portuguese, I <a href=""https://opennlp.apache.org/docs/2.5.3/manual/opennlp.html#tools.corpora.arvores-deitadas"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">followed the instructions</a> and did the training first using the ChunkerConverter tool (to convert from &quot;arvore deitada&quot; to CoNLL2000) and then generating the model with ChunkerTrainerME tool. Everything worked well. For the sentence above, the chunker produced correct tags ([B-NP, B-VP, B-NP, I-NP]).</p>
<p>But, for more complex sentences, it hasn't produced such good results.</p>
<p>I was trying to identify what I could improve in chunker training, and one of the things I noticed is that there is a difference between the types of tags. The portuguese corpus (<a href=""https://www.linguateca.pt/Floresta/corpus.html#download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Bosque 8.0</a>) seems to be using portuguese tags. For example, instead of <strong>PROPN</strong>, the corpus uses <strong>prop</strong> and instead of <strong>DET</strong>, it uses <strong>art</strong>.</p>
<p>It seems to me that this could lead to problems, especially since one of the parameters the chunker receives is an array with UD tags, but it has been trained with another type of tag...</p>
<p>But before writing code creating a routine to convert from a portuguese notation to UD (or Penn) I wanted to ask, if</p>
<ol>
<li>this does indeed have an impact,</li>
<li>there is a tool that already does this translation and</li>
<li>there are any other suggestions for improving the chunker precision/recall.</li>

PunktTokenizer does not work with Russian `я.`,"<p>When tokenizing paragraphs to sentences in the Russian language, I am observing the special case when the sequence is not treated as the end of the sentence. The case is with the <code>я.</code> at the end of the sentence. See the working example:</p>

    print(f'{n}: {s!r}')

print('-----------------')
line = 'Родилась заново, стал размышлять я. - Она не застрелена, а это дело упрощает.'

<p>The second case works as expected. It differs only in adding the dash (kind of introduction of the speaker's note [sorry for my lack of terms]).</p>
<p>The <code>я</code> is not present in the Russian abbreviations (<code>c:\nltk_data\tokenizers\punkt_tab\russian\abbrev_types.txt</code>). However, even when added to the file with abbreviations, it does not make a difference.</p>

How To Detect Is Text Human Readable?,"<p>I am wondering if there's a way to tell a given text is human readable. By human readable, I mean: it has some meanings, format like an article written by somebody, or at least generated by a software translator that is intended to be read by a human.</p>

<p>Here's the background story: recently I am making an app that allows user to upload a short text to a database. At the early stage of deployment I noticed some user always uploaded corrupted text due to a problem with encoding. This problem is fixed later, but leaves me wonder if there's a way to pick up non human readable text before serving the text back to users.</p>

<p>Any advice will be appreciated. The scope might be too large to include other languages, so at the moment let's limit the discussion to English only.</p>

Why is the vocab size of Byte level BPE smaller than Unicode&#39;s vocab size?,"<p>I recently read GPT2 and the paper says:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This would result in a base vocabulary of over 130,000 before any multi-symbol tokens are added.  This is prohibitively large compared to the 32,000 to 64,000 token vocabularies often used with BPE. In contrast, a byte-level version of BPE only requires a base vocabulary of size 256.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I really don't understand the words. The number of characters that Unicode represents is 130K but how can this be reduced to 256? Where's the rest of approximately 129K characters? What am I missing? Does byte-level BPE allow duplicating of representation between different characters?</p>
<p>I don't understand the logic. Below are my questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Why the size of vocab is reduced? (from 130K to 256)</li>
<li>What's the logic of the BBPE (Byte-level BPE)?</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<h1>Detail question</h1>
<p>Thank you for your answer but I really don't get it. Let's say we have 130K unique characters. What we want (and BBPE do) is to reduce this basic (unique) vocabulary. Each Unicode character can be converted 1 to 4 bytes by utilizing UTF-8 encoding. The original paper of BBPE says (Neural Machine Translation with Byte-Level Subwords):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Representing text at the level of bytes and <strong>using the 256 bytes</strong> set as vocabulary is a potential solution to this issue.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Each byte can represent 256 characters (bits, 2^8), we only need 2^17 (131072) bits for representing the unique Unicode characters. In this case, where did the <strong>256 bytes in the original paper</strong> come from? I don't know both the logic and how to derive this result.</p>
<p>I arrange my questions again, more detail:</p>
<ul>
<li>How does BBPE work?</li>
<li>Why the size of vocab is reduced? (from 130K to 256 bytes)
<ul>
<li>Anyway, we always need 130K space for a vocab. What's the difference between representing unique characters as Unicode and Bytes?</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

Removing various symbols from a text,"<p>I am trying to <strong>clean</strong> some texts that are very different from one another. I would like to remove the headlines, quotation marks, abbreviations, special symbols and points that don't actually end sentences.</p>

<pre><code>This is a headline

And inside the text there are 'abbreviations', e.g. &quot;bzw.&quot; in German or some German dates, like 2. Dezember 2017. Sometimes there are even enumerations, that I might just eliminate completely.

"Is there a database, API, or parsable text for getting verb conjugations?","<p>This isn't directly a programming question, so I apologize in advance. I've been working on a grammar-free random sentence generator for a typing game I'd like to make, and I've been having a difficult time finding any parsable (or callable) data for getting verb conjugations. Ultimately, if I can't find anything like this, I'm going to have to go through the dictionary I've created and add first-person singular and plural, second-person singular and plural, third-person singular and plural, simple past, past participle, and present participle forms for every irregular verb.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a problem in many languages, but there are so many irregular English verbs that this could take a long, long time to do manually. I'm not against the worse option, but I want to make sure I'm not going to be wasting obscene hours doing it myself when there is some database I can use instead.</p>

<p>I've seen <a href=""http://www.scientificpsychic.com/verbs1.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.scientificpsychic.com/verbs1.html</a> and spoken with the creator, but he doesn't release his exact dictionary (just the classes for it). I've also seen sites like <a href=""http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/English/find.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.verbix.com/webverbix/English/find.html</a>, which would be great for scraping, but that's a bit of a pain as well.</p>

<p>This question has been asked here before ( <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8424806/verb-conjugations-database"">Verb Conjugations Database</a> ), but the question was left unanswered, and the asker alluded to solving the problem but never said what the solution was.</p>

Extracting English imperative mood from verb tags with spaCy,"<p>I would like to detect the imperative mood of verbs in English sentences. From <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53755559/how-to-extract-tag-attributes-using-spacy"">this question</a> I'm aware that spaCy has access to extended morphological features, but I don't see them when I use it, using spaCy version 2.1.8, Python 3.7.1:</p>

Show VB {74: 100, 'VerbForm': 'inf'} VERB ROOT
</code></pre>

<p>Looks like spaCy correctly inferred that ""show"" is a verb, but it appears that it thinks it's an infinitive, and I see no mood information from the <code>tag_map</code>. I realize that this extended information is available in my linked question because Italian was being parsed there and determining the mood may be simpler for Romance-inflected verbs. </p>

<p>In any case, does any extended information about mood exist for verbs in English sentences?</p>

Determining most popular words in the English dictionary within a dictionary of words,"<p>Forgive me if my wording is awful, but I'm trying to figure out how to determine the most used words in the English language from a set of words in a dictionary I've made. I've done some research on NLTK but can't seem to find a function within it (or any other library for that matter) that will help me do what I need to do.</p>

A sentence &quot;I enjoy a cold glass of water on a hot day&quot; would return &quot;water&quot; because it's the most used word in day to day conversation from the sentence. Essentially I need a returned value of the most frequently used word in conversations.</p>

Integrate Python Model to Power Bi,"<p>In power BI  I have to create a NLP based chatbot kind of thing, like we have QnA visual in power bi which can answer the question asked in Natural Language Processing but it due to some of it's limitations I can't use.</p>
<p>I want to train my dataset using python and create a model which can answer any question asked in natural language.
However the problem is I can't run python script into Power bi , since there is no gateway connection for it so it will not refresh, I do not have to do in my local system only it should be reached out to end user. Anything if I load into power bi will eventually look like a table  and I have to create a visual of it.</p>
<p>I want to know in what ways it could be possible to use the QnA model written in python to inculcate the python model into power bi, so that a user can go search about the question they want to ask in a  natural language.</p>
<p>Is there a way to use python so that the end user can type their question and get their answer like a chat bot?</p>

Why do Transformers in Natural Language Processing need a stack of encoders?,"<p>I am following this blog on transformers</p>

I understand that the multi-headed attention layers capture different representation spaces of the problem. I don't understand why there needs to be a vertical stack of encoders and decoders. Wouldn't one encoder/decoder layer work?</p>

facebook/m2m100_418M model - how to translate longer sequences of text,"<p>I have this extracted the following text from Wikipedia's Wiki (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a>),</p>
<pre><code>A wiki is a form of hypertext publication on the internet which is collaboratively edited and managed by its audience directly through a web browser. A typical wiki contains multiple pages that can either be edited by the public or limited to use within an organization for maintaining its internal knowledge base.

Wikis are powered by wiki software, also known as wiki engines. Being a form of content management system, these differ from other web-based systems such as blog software or static site generators in that the content is created without any defined owner or leader. Wikis have little inherent structure, allowing one to emerge according to the needs of the users. Wiki engines usually allow content to be written using a lightweight markup language and sometimes edited with the help of a rich-text editor. There are dozens of different wiki engines in use, both standalone and part of other software, such as bug tracking systems. Some wiki engines are free and open-source, whereas others are proprietary. Some permit control over different functions (levels of access); for example, editing rights may permit changing, adding, or removing material. Others may permit access without enforcing access control. Further rules may be imposed to organize content. In addition to hosting user-authored content, wikis allow those users to interact, hold discussions, and collaborate.

Is there a free library for morphological analysis of the German language?,"<p>I'm looking for a library which can perform a morphological analysis on German words, i.e. it converts any word into its root form and providing meta information about the analysed word.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>gegessen -&gt; essen
wurde [...] gefasst -&gt; fassen
Häuser -&gt; Haus
Hunde -&gt; Hund
</code></pre>

<p>My wishlist:</p>

<ul>
<li>It has to work with both nouns and verbs.</li>
<li>I'm aware that this is a very hard task given the complexity of the German language, so I'm also looking for libaries which provide only approximations or may only be 80% accurate.</li>
<li>I'd prefer libraries which don't work with dictionaries, but again I'm open to compromise given the cirumstances.</li>
<li>I'd also prefer C/C++/Delphi Windows libraries, because that would make them easier to integrate but .NET, Java, ... will also do.</li>
<li>It has to be a free library. (L)GPL, MPL, ...</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong> I'm aware that there is no way to perform a morphological analysis without any dictionary at all, because of the irregular words. 
When I say, I prefer a library without a dictionary I mean those full blown dictionaries which map each and every word:</p>

<pre><code>arbeite -&gt; arbeiten
arbeitest -&gt; arbeiten
arbeitet -&gt; arbeiten
arbeitete -&gt; arbeiten
arbeitetest -&gt; arbeiten
arbeiteten -&gt; arbeiten
arbeitetet -&gt; arbeiten
gearbeitet -&gt; arbeiten
arbeite -&gt; arbeiten
... 
</code></pre>

<p>Those dictionaries have several drawbacks, including the huge size and the inability to process unknown words.</p>

<p>Of course all exceptions can only be handled with a dictionary:</p>

<pre><code>esse -&gt; essen
isst -&gt; essen
eßt -&gt; essen
aß -&gt; essen
aßt -&gt; essen
aßen -&gt; essen

Efficient implementation of BPE using priority queue,"<p>I think that it is not strictly BPE (<a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_pair_encoding"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">byte pair encoding</a>), but there is a similar idea applied to strings.</p>

<p>Suppose there are three Chinese words in the dictionary (I will use a huge dictionary like <a href=""https://cc-cedict.org/editor/editor.php?handler=Download"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CEDICT</a> for practical use.)</p>

<ul>
<li>我</li>
<li>喜欢</li>
<li>水果</li>
</ul>

<p>Then take an input like this below.</p>

<p>我喜欢水果 (I like fruit)</p>

<p>Since Chinese texts are not splitted by white spaces, it's difficult to process.</p>

<p>We can decompose the input string into multiple single characters.</p>

<p>我 喜 欢 水 果</p>

<p>Then lookup new symbol pair at [left, right] and combine them. If the combined word is in the dictionary, we can replace the combined word with a new symbol.</p>

<ul>
<li>我喜</li>
<li>喜欢 &lt;- in the dic</li>
<li>欢水</li>
<li>水果 &lt;- in the dic</li>
</ul>

<p>We found two new symbols, so the input text becomes </p>

<p>我 喜欢 水果</p>

<p>We should iterate until we cannot find any combined word in the dictionary. In this case, we cannot find a new symbol in the dictionary.</p>

<ul>
<li>我喜欢 水果</li>
<li>喜欢水果</li>
</ul>

<p>It's not difficult to implement this naively but we need to scan adjoining two words many times. Some said we can implement BPE efficiently with a priority queue. I'm not familiar with compression algorithms. I would be grateful if someone could tell me the implementation or useful documentations.</p>

<p>In this method, out of vocabulary words are decomposed into single characters, so we can avoid unknown words problems.</p>

<p>Best regards,</p>

Poor lemmatization in Apple&#39;s Natural Language framework,"<p>I did a quick experiment to check the accuracy of lemmatization in Apple's Natural Language framework and the results are quite poor.</p>

<p>I wonder if I am doing something wrong or if the framework is really that bad.</p>

<p>For the experiment, I used code straight from Apple's documentation (which also gets repeated in the few online examples I could find).</p>

<pre><code>let tagger = NLTagger(tagSchemes: [.lemma])
tagger.string = text
let options: NLTagger.Options = [.omitPunctuation, .omitWhitespace]
tagger.enumerateTags(in: text.startIndex..&lt;text.endIndex, unit: .word, scheme: .lemma, options: options) { tag, tokenRange in
    print(""\(text[tokenRange]): \(tag?.rawValue ?? ""NO LEMMA"")"")
    return true
}
</code></pre>

<p>To test the output, I took a paragraph from a Euronews article, which is available in multiple languages.</p>

<p>The English version seems accurate, but in English, most words coincide with their lemma, so it's not a great benchmark.</p>

<p>I'm running the code in an Xcode Playground, on macOS 10.14.6. I tried both <em>macOS</em> and <em>iOS</em> as the platform for the playground, which makes no difference.</p>

<pre><code>let text = ""For the possible necessity of short-time work I want to make sure to build an incentive with connecting it to training.

<p>Here most words produce no lemma. These are not rare words, and in my opinion, they should not be hard to lemmatize either (but I am no NLP expert).</p>

<p>For example, the word ""быстро"" (fast, quickly) is among the top 300 most common Russian words and is an adverb of the adjective ""быстрый"". That's definitely a word I would expect a lemmatizer to recognize. Like the word ""хочу"" which is ""I want"".</p>

How to deal with word counts of zero when calculating Pointwise Mutual Information (PMI) for word cooccurrences in Natural Language Processing,"<p>I have a co-occurrence matrix of words in a text (two words x and y are considered co-occurring, if they both occur in a context window of w words). I want to calculate the Pointwise Mutual Information for two words x and y which I do using the common formula</p>
<p><code>PMI(x, y) = log2(P(x, y) / P(x)*P(y))</code>.</p>
<p>There may be cases, where <code>P(x)*P(y) = 0</code>, e.g.:</p>
<div class=""s-table-container""><table class=""s-table"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>X</th>
<th>Not X</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Y</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not Y</td>
<td>0</td>
<td>1500</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>or</p>
<div class=""s-table-container""><table class=""s-table"">
<thead>
<tr>
<th></th>
<th>X</th>
<th>Not X</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Y</td>
<td>30</td>
<td>0</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Not Y</td>
<td>1000</td>
<td>100</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table></div>
<p>How do I handle such cases in order to avoid a math error in my Python Script (division by zero) as well as avoiding messing up the data?</p>
<p>I tried to find information on websites explaining PMI, but they don't mention this special case. Either this does not happen often (which I cannot believe, since there must be something like &quot;perfect&quot; PMI) or the solution to this is so trivial, that everyone knows it, but no one speaks about it. What can be done to handle the problem?</p>
<p>My ideas so far:</p>
<ol>
<li>Define what should happen in such a case and catch it with an if-clause, then manually assign the desired value. But this seems inexact to me and depends on many non-binary factors. E.g., in table one there is a total correlation, in table two the correlation is rather coincidental, given that nearly the whole corpus consists of x and y is bound to occur with it.</li>
<li>Use some kind of additive smoothing as suggested in a comment on <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/13492808/14393183"">this thread</a>, i.e. adding a positive value to all values involved in the calculation. But what should this value be in order to not skew the frequency distribution even for small corpora - 1, 0.1, 0.001, something totally different?</li>
</ol>
<p>I would be glad about any hint for procedures usually accepted when working with PMI.</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>EDIT</strong></p>
<p>It turns out that the problem I had was due to a misunderstanding of PMI on my side. In the above examples, P(x)*P(y) is not 0, because each word occurs at least 30 times.
Not the probability of x and y occurring without the other word respectively is relevant, but the probability of them occurring at all, which includes the times that they occur with the other word.</p>
<p>In case that x and/or y <em>never</em> occur in the entire corpus, manually catching this problem (e.g., like @Mustafa suggest in their answer) might help.</p>

Classify data on unstructured texts using python,"<p>I'm going to give an introduction to the project surroundings so you have some context for helping me out.</p>
<p>I'm trying to parse out information of german organizational charts in pdf format. Right now I can reliably read out the content of the rectangles from the PDF and get all textblocks that are contained in that rectangle. For each rectangle, I want to sort the information inside it into several categories. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Type (the type of the suborganization. e.g. Referat)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Title (the specific name of the suborganization. e.g. Referat XI A 9)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Description (the responsibilities. e.g. Personalien der Zollverwaltung und der Bundesmonopolverwaltung für Branntwein)</p>
</li>
<li><p>Person in charge (e.g. MR Hoffmann)</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I looked into several different approaches using python but I couldn't find a fitting solution. With spacy I found it hard to get any meaningful results because the text inside a rectangle isn't a real sentence and, as far as I understand, spacy relies on identifying the part-of-speech a token has in a sentence.<br />
I read into some other approaches using bag-of-words for example but this also doesn't seem to make sense because I again don't have full sentences. I'm currently implementing a really large but simple pattern matching solution where I check for keywords like &quot;Referat&quot; or the prefix of a person &quot;MR&quot; and categorize based on that. This regex-approach obviously fails pretty quickly as soon as I don't have a specified prefix or keyword to search for in the given text.</p>
<p>I also tried taking into account at which positions the textblocks are placed inside the content node and parse the information based on that. But this approach fails as soon as the order differs between the pdfs.</p>
<p>I'm looking for general advice that points me to a solution for this problem using python. The questions regarding this topic seems to be very old or focus only on a subset of the problems that I have so I think it would be helpful to have another discussion.</p>

How is transformers loss calculated for blank token predictions?,"<p>I'm currently trying to implement a transformer and have trouble understanding its loss calculation.</p>

Pretrained Translation model(french to english) for food related data,"<p>I am working on a project that involves mapping between two food-related datasets.

How can i make a transformer output a translation relative to a specific context,"<p>I am working a machine-translation-like project, where i have a transformer with the encoder-decoder structure, which is supposed to generate SQL queries from natural language commands, example:</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Count the number of aircrafts produced by the company XYZ</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM aircrafts WHERE manufacturer='XYZ';</p>
<p>Now i have kind of achieved my goal and my model can generate decent looking queries in most of cases, but there's still one problem to solve, which is that the queries it could generate are all SYNTACTICALLY correct but it doesn't nail the attributes/tables names, for example:</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Count the number of aircrafts produced by the company XYZ</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> SELECT COUNT(*) FROM aircrafts WHERE produced='XYZ';</p>
<p>or:</p>
<p><strong>Input:</strong> Show all the employees older than 40</p>
<p><strong>Output:</strong> SELECT * FROM employee WHERE country &gt; 40;</p>
<p>So like i said, syntactically-speaking the query has no errors but it sure cannot be executed correctly on the database itself.</p>
<p>My model is trained on a json dataset that contains a list of samples who follows the following form:</p>
<pre><code>[
  [
    &quot;Count the number of aircraft produced by company XYZ&quot;,
    &quot;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM aircraft WHERE manufacturer = 'XYZ';&quot;
  ],
  [
    &quot;How many marine species are found in the Atlantic Ocean?&quot;,
    &quot;SELECT COUNT(*) FROM marine_species WHERE location = 'Atlantic Ocean';&quot;
  ]
]
</code></pre>
<p>Although i found some datasets that contains the schema of the database as a set of CREATE queries like this one:</p>
<pre><code>{&quot;instruction&quot;: &quot;CREATE TABLE table_72445 (
    \&quot;County\&quot; text,
    \&quot;Population\&quot; real,
    \&quot;Per capita income\&quot; text,
    \&quot;Median household income\&quot; text,
    \&quot;Median family income\&quot; text
)
-- Name the median family income for riverside&quot;,
&quot;output&quot;: &quot;SELECT \&quot;Median family income\&quot; FROM table_72445 WHERE \&quot;County\&quot; = 'Riverside'&quot;}
</code></pre>
<p>So is there anyway i can leverage this kind of dataset so i can give my transformer the database context it should work on, or is there any other way to achieve this task goal?</p>
<p>NOTE: i cannot make the previous corpus as a whole my input, because it will result in a huge performance-overhead. Imagine defining the very SAME set that contains tens of tables every single time that i want to execute, so this is no choice to take.</p>

Trying to cluster short survey answers (1 to 10 words). Am I on the right track?,"<p>Here's the explanation of what i want to fully make (its a project for school).</p>
<ol>
<li>A user just puts in a file with just the answers to whatever question was asked in the survey.</li>
</ol>
<p>2.The machine finds similar answers and groups them under one label or cluster that is unnamed (thinking of using MeanShift, GMM, KMeans)</p>
<ol start=""3"">
<li>If possible I would also like it to generate a label for the cluster.</li>
</ol>
<p>4.Write the clustered and labeled answers back into a file to be checked and used for whatever purpose.</p>
<p>Some context on the data: lots of short (with some long, 10+ words) answers like &quot;i dont know&quot;, &quot;??&quot;, &quot;helpful&quot;, &quot;red&quot;, etc. and each has anywhere from 200 to 2000 answers.The answers are in dutch or french, would it be recomanded I translate them to english for better performance? Usually there are around 7 to 20 (high amounts are rare) clusters. I also have the right labels for the answers so I can check if the algorithm has clustered correctly.</p>
<p>I have tried looking into it and I need to vectorize my texts first, for this I tried TF-IDF and Count vectorizer in scikit. I also found their cheat sheet and It recommands i use MeanShift.</p>
<p>I havent tried looking for the best parameters yet, but the performance seem very poor (close to random). I used Adjusted Rand Index, Normalized Mutual Information and Silhouette Score to evbaluate.</p>
<p>Am I on the right track or are there better things out there? Vectorization methods, embeddings, clustering algorithms?</p>
<p>Edit: I just realized something that may overthrow the algorithm. In each survey there is a category named ´others´. It is a category with actual answers that are just irrelevant.</p>
<p>Possible workaroud i think way work: The gategory is ´small´ with around 8%. My clustering algorithm always makes way too many classes, but i could try to figure out a balance between combining classes of 1 or 2 answers into ´others´.</p>

How does the model.resize_token_embeddings() function refactor the embeddings for newly added tokens in the tokenizer?,"<p>I am new to Natural Language Processing and currently working on machine translation using ALMA-7B model from Hugging Face.

I am adding the tokens to tokenizers using following code:</p>
<p><code>alma_tokenizer.add_tokens(word_chunks)</code></p>
<p>Where <code>alma_tokenizer</code> is the Tokenizer for ALMA-7B model and <code>word_chunks</code> is a list of words I want to add. I want to update the model with its corresponding word embeddings as well, in the model and I was suggested to use <code>resize_token_embeddings()</code> function of <code>AutoModelForCausalLM</code>. When used it actually created new embeddings for the tokens I had added and I confirmed it as well. But my question is how are these embeddings created? Are they created randomly (as they are not a tensor of zeroes)? Can I insert my embeddings instead of the embeddings created by them?</p>

Most similar words within a given context,"<p>I want to create a deep learning model that can generate context-aware synonyms. I've been thinking about using BERT since it is bidirectional and creates good representations, and my idea was to use an approach where I provide the model with both the original sentence (e.g. &quot;It is a beautiful house&quot;) and the same sentence but where the word I want to find synonyms for is masked (e.g. &quot;It is a [MASK] house&quot;, if I want to find synonyms for beautiful).</p>
<p>A normal fill-mask obviously wouldn't work since it would not provide the model with the actual word we want to find synonyms for. I was thinking about using a machine translation-model (e.g. T5) instead, where you don't translate the sentence from one language to another but make an e.g. English-to-English translation where you provide the original sentence (&quot;It is a beautiful house&quot;) as input to the encoder and the masked sentence (&quot;It is a [MASK] house&quot;) as another input - this sentence would so to speak be the equivalent of an almost completed translation of the original sentence, and instead of simply translating the missing word, it would give me the top k most probable logits as synonyms.</p>
<p>However, I'm not sure how I can make this work at all... Another approach would be to train BERT on a domain-specific corpus and then get the k-nearest neighbors of the word I want to find synonyms for, but from what I've read it's not possible to get the word representations from a model like BERT the same way you would from Word2Vec and GloVe.</p>
<p>Any suggestions on how I can solve this challenge? Any help would be greatly appreciated...</p>

My plan is to pretrain the model on freely available Arabic newspaper articles that specifically tackle the same sectors as the government ones, including education, healthcare, etc. I know these articles are not considered too specific to the target domain, but they are the only suitable data available. I plan to pretrain the model on around 20K articles only since I am limited with time and computational resources. Also, the target dataset contains about 2K citizen reviews provided in Modern Standard Arabic.</p>
<p>So, I have several questions concerning this project:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Would it be beneficial to pretrain the Arabic BERT model from scratch using this small dataset of 20K samples? or would it be too small to tackle my problem?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Would it be better to apply further pretraining for Arabic BERT model, which means starting with the model initial knowledge (weights) and then further pretraining it on the 20K samples? I am afraid this will lead to model forgetting for the previously learnt knowledge. Also, the combination of general and specific knowledge might affect the model performance on the target dataset of citizen reviews.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Whichever method I choose from above, should I pretrain the model on unlabeled data (unsupervised learning)? or is it better to train it on labeled data to be useful for text classification?</p>
</li>
<li><p>After pretraining the model, should I apply feature extraction or fine-tuning on the target dataset of citizen reviews?</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>After extensive research, I found that domain-specific models outperform the general ones. Also, it is advised to use pretraining from scartch to make the model specific to the target domain. However, this requires large amount of data and computational power. So, I am not sure if 20K samples are enough. Furthermore, I am not sure if further pretraining will be beneficial for the specific domain target data.</p>

Which component in a transformer architecture is actually responsible form mapping a given word into the most likely next word?,"<p>I've been trying to gain intuition on how transformers work behind the scenes for language translation. I implemented in <a href=""https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HdBN9cM0v7SWPZk_KJrpfMLncDw_ENJ7yFJobevJnak/edit?usp=sharing"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">a spreadsheet</a> in order to visualize the math behind and how the embeddings are transformed. But, there's one component that still is not clear to me which is: where the &quot;next word mapping&quot; is really occurring.</p>
<p>For example, let's consider a small inference task from Spanish &quot;yo estoy bien&quot; into English as &quot;I am fine&quot;. Given an input sequence that starts with <code>[&lt;BOS&gt;, 'I', 'am']</code>, which component of the transformer model is tasked with transforming the embedding of 'am' into the embedding for the subsequent word 'fine'? I know that all of them are somewhat involved, but which one is the key one?</p>
<p>Here's my current understanding of possible roles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Masked Causal Self-Attention: Maps relationships within words in the target language (e.g., between 'I' and 'am'), but does it aid in choosing 'fine' as the next word?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Cross-Attention: Finds correlations between source and target language words (e.g., 'I' with 'yo' and 'am' with 'sono'), but is it responsible for producing the next word in the sequence?</p>
</li>
<li><p>Feed-Forward Layers: Execute linear transformations of embeddings without considering the context from other words in the sentence. How could they be responsible for selecting 'fine' following 'am' without context from other embeddings?</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In short, what I see in the attention mechanisms is that they operate by adjusting an embedding to align more closely with the embeddings they share the greatest similarity with. But, what I would expect in the cross-attention is actually to see the word 'am' having a high similarity with most likely next work, 'bien'. So the new embedding from 'am' would be mapped into 'fine' which is the English equivalent embedding to 'bien'.</p>
<p>I hope I was able to make my question clear. It is hard for me to explain it. But I appreciate anyone who could give me some directions on the right path. Thanks</p>

Language detection for short user-generated string,"<p>I need to detect the language of text sent in chat, and I am faced with 2 problems:</p>

</ul>
<p>For the noise, I clean the message and that works fine, but the length of the message is a problem.</p>
<p>For example, if a user writes &quot;hi&quot;, Fasttext detects the language as Dutch text, but Google Translate detects it as English. And most likely it is a message in English.</p>
<p>I try to train my own Fasttext model, but how can I adjust the model to have better results with short strings? Do I need to train the model with the dictionary of a lot of languages to get a better result?</p>

Best way to identify and extract dates from text Python?,"<p>As part of a larger personal project I'm working on, I'm attempting to separate out inline dates from a variety of text sources.</p>

<p>For example, I have a large list of strings (that usually take the form of English sentences or statements) that take a variety of forms:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Central design committee session Tuesday 10/22 6:30 pm</p>
  
  <p>Th 9/19 LAB: Serial encoding (Section 2.2)</p>
  
  <p>There will be another one on December 15th for those who are unable to make it today.</p>
  
  <p>Workbook 3 (Minimum Wage): due Wednesday 9/18 11:59pm</p>
  
  <p>He will be flying in Sept. 15th.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While these dates are in-line with natural text, none of them are in specifically natural language forms themselves (e.g., there's no ""The meeting will be two weeks from tomorrow""—it's all explicit).  </p>

<p>As someone who doesn't have too much experience with this kind of processing, what would be the best place to begin? I've looked into things like the <code>dateutil.parser</code> module and <a href=""https://github.com/bear/parsedatetime"">parsedatetime</a>, but those seem to be for <em>after</em> you've isolated the date.</p>

<p>Because of this, is there any good way to extract the date and the extraneous text </p>

<pre><code>input:  Th 9/19 LAB: Serial encoding (Section 2.2)
output: ['Th 9/19', 'LAB: Serial encoding (Section 2.2)']

How to improve the flair NER-model results?,"<p>I am new to NER and NLP in general and I want to know if I understood the material right.
So for example I have pre-trained model &quot;ner-english-large&quot;.
I am using a model and it turns out that the model is not recognizing the right entities.</p>
<p>(In this example 'Dsl' wasn't marked as ORG)</p>
<pre><code>from flair.data import Sentence
from flair.models import SequenceTagger
from flair.data import Corpus
from flair.trainers import ModelTrainer

tagger = SequenceTagger.load(&quot;flair/ner-english-large&quot;)
sentence = Sentence(&quot;Dsl hit 100% success in sales across all the world&quot;)
tagger.predict(sentence)
sentence.get_spans('ner')
</code></pre>
<pre><code>#output
[]
</code></pre>
<p>So I want to improve my model.
I am uploading this sentence to the corpus in the appropriate format.</p>
<pre><code>columns = {0 : 'text', 1 : 'ner'}
data_folder = &quot;train&quot;
corpus: Corpus = ColumnCorpus(data_folder, columns)
label_type = 'ner'
label_dict = corpus.make_label_dictionary(label_type=label_type)
</code></pre>
<p>Then I am initializing the <code>trainer</code></p>
<pre><code>tagger = SequenceTagger.load(&quot;flair/ner-english-large&quot;)
trainer = ModelTrainer(tagger, corpus)
</code></pre>
<p>But after this I am a little bit confused about what I should do next.
Before that, I tried <code>train</code> method and it worked. Data (that was previously recognized incorrectly) was recognized as needed.</p>
<pre><code>trainer.train('fine/taggers/continued_model',
              learning_rate=0.01,
              mini_batch_size=32,
              max_epochs=6)
</code></pre>
<p>But I don't know if this is the correct method or I need to use <code>fine-tune</code>? Could you explain which approach is more correct?</p>

How can I enhance morphological information for English models in spaCy?,"<p>I am trying to detect verbs that are in the imperative mood using English models in spaCy but I am seeing morphological features that are inconsistent with the examples found in the <a href=""https://spacy.io/usage/linguistic-features#morphology"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Morphology</a> documentation. This issue is similar to this unanswered <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/59008046/72992"">Extracting English imperative mood from verb tags with spaCy</a> question. Specifically, there seems to very few <a href=""https://universaldependencies.org/u/feat/Mood.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">mood</a> features identified.</p>

"Python NLP: identifying the tense of a sentence using TextBlob, StanfordNLP or Google Cloud","<p>(Note: I am aware that there have been previous posts on this question (e.g. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/30016904/determining-tense-of-a-sentence-python"">here</a> or <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/22139866/finding-tense-of-a-sentence-using-stanford-nlp/22146151#22146151"">here</a>, but they are rather old and I think there has been quite some progress in NLP in the past few years.)</p>

<p>I am trying to determine the tense of a sentence, using natural language processing in Python. </p>

<p>Is there an easy-to-use package for this? If not, how would I need to implement solutions in TextBlob, StanfordNLP or Google Cloud Natural Language API?</p>

<p>TextBlob seems easiest to use, and I manage to get the POS tags listed, but I am not sure how I can turn the output into a 'tense prediction value' or simply a best guess on the tense. Moreover, my text is in Spanish, so I would prefer to use GoogleCloud or StanfordNLP (or any other easy to use solution) which support Spanish.</p>

<p>I have not managed to work with the Python interface for StanfordNLP. </p>

<p>Google Cloud Natural Language API seems to offer exactly what I need (see <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/natural-language/docs/reference/rest/v1/Token#tense"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>, but I have not managed to find out how I would get to this output. I have used Google Cloud NLP for other analysis (e.g. entity sentiment analysis) and it has worked, so I am confident I could set it up if I find the right example of use.</p>

<p>Example of textblob: </p>

<pre><code>from textblob import TextBlob
from textblob.taggers import NLTKTagger
nltk_tagger = NLTKTagger()
blob = TextBlob(""I am curious to see whether NLP is able to predict the tense of this sentence., pos_tagger=nltk_tagger)
print(blob.pos_tags)
</code></pre>

<p>-> this prints the pos tags, how would I convert them into a prediction of the tense of this sentence?</p>

<p>Example with Google Cloud NLP (after setting up credentials):</p>

<pre><code>from google.cloud import language
from google.cloud.language import enums
from google.cloud.language import types
text = ""I am curious to see how this works""
client = language.LanguageServiceClient()
document = types.Document(
    content=text,
    type=enums.Document.Type.PLAIN_TEXT)

tense = (WHAT NEEDS TO COME HERE?)
print(tense)
</code></pre>

<p>-> I am not sure about the code that needs to be entered to predict the tense (indicated in the code)</p>

Customize word embeddings to your own vocabulary,"<p>I have a vocabulary related to restaurant stuff in Spanish and I am using predefined word embeddings in Spanish with FastText and Bert, however, I see that there are a lot of out-of-vocabulary (oov) words that are not recognized by the predefined word embeddings.

Feature selection and unsupervised learning for multilingual data + machine learning algorithm selection,"<p><strong>Questions</strong></p>

<p>I want to classify/categorize/cluster/group together a set of several thousand websites. There's data that we can train on, so we can do supervised learning, but it's not data that we've gathered and we're not adamant about using it -- so we're also considering unsupervised learning.</p>

<ul>
<li><p>What features can I use in a machine learning algorithm to deal with multilingual data? Note that some of these languages might not have been dealt with in the Natural Language Processing field.</p></li>
<li><p>If I were to use an unsupervised learning algorithm, should I just partition the data by language and deal with each language differently? Different languages might have different relevant categories (or not, depending on your psycholinguistic theoretical tendencies), which might affect the decision to partition.</p></li>
<li><p>I was thinking of using decision trees, or maybe Support Vector Machines (SVMs) to allow for more features (from my understanding of them). <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3789856/newbie-where-to-start-given-a-problem-to-predict-future-success-or-not/3791608#3791608"">This post</a> suggests random forests instead of SVMs. Any thoughts?</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Pragmatical approaches are welcome! (Theoretical ones, too, but those might be saved for later fun.)</p>

<p><strong>Some context</strong></p>

<p>We are trying to classify a corpus of many thousands of websites in 3 to 5 languages (maybe up to 10, but we're not sure).</p>

<p>We have training data in the form of hundreds of websites already classified. However, we may choose to use that data set or not -- if other categories make more sense, we're open to not using the training data that we have, since it is not something we gathered in the first place. We are on the final stages of scraping data/text from websites.</p>

<p>Now we must decide on the issues above. I have done some work with the Brown Corpus and the Brill tagger, but this will not work because of the multiple-languages issue.</p>

"If an FST transition is based on a given context, how can it be called as &#39;non deterministic&#39;?","<p>I am going through the paper 'SPEECH RECOGNITION WITH WEIGHTED FINITE-STATE TRANSDUCERS' (hbka.pdf - <a href=""https://cs.nyu.edu/%7Emohri/pub/hbka.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://cs.nyu.edu/~mohri/pub/hbka.pdf</a>)</p>

<p>[<strong>Here ae/k t represents the triphonic model for ae with left context k and right context t. This transition is considered as non-deterministic. Why?</strong>]</p>
<p>The differences between transitions that are termed 'non-deterministic' and 'deterministic' are</p>
<ol>
<li>Nondeterministic transitions allow (epsilon transitions) a transition to happen between states without any input symbol consumption and/or any output symbol generation.</li>
</ol>
<p>This is especially useful where the transducer is supposed to output English word morphological description from the input English word, like in cities -&gt; city -PL. Here there are transitions between states where you input and output the same alphabet. But when you input i or e you need not output anything and in the final transition for input s you would output y -PL</p>
<p>So, I understand the need for epsilon transitions. I also understand that non-deterministic transitions are when multiple transitions for same input label can exist. This could lead to ambiguity and hence supports the name 'non-deterministic'.</p>
<ol start=""2"">
<li>Deterministic transitions are the very opposite of the above. No multiple transitions for same input label; hence every transition is unique. No epsilon transitions.</li>
</ol>
<p>With this limited knowing, I could not decipher why a transition could ever be called 'non-deterministic' when you have provided the context. Here ae/k t represents the triphonic model for ae with left context k and right context t. This transition is considered as non-deterministic. Why?</p>
<p>The main idea of providing context is to remove the ambiguity.</p>

Translation between different tokenizers,"<p>Sorry if this question is too basic to be asked here. I tried but I couldn't find solutions.</p>
<p>I'm now working on an NLP project that requires using two different models (BART for summarization and BERT for QA). I want to concatenate the two models so that I can train them at the same time instead of separately. However, the two models use different tokenizers. Is there a way to create a layer mapping the output of the first layer to the second one? Would creating a dictionary by hand (mapping every single available value of the tokenizer) work?  Thanks a lot!</p>

Natural Language Processing for an optimal solution to Hangman,"<p>I have a dictionary of 250,000 words and am supposed to design an algorithm to play the game of Hangman as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>We are given a random word, not necessarily from the dictionary.</li>
<li>We have N attempts to guess the correct word by guessing each letter individually. Each incorrect guess leads to a penalty leading to losing an attempt.</li>
<li>Unlimited correct guesses are allowed.</li>
<li>The game stops when we either make N incorrect guesses or we have guessed the correct word.</li>
</ol>
<p>A common algorithm I came across is as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>The algorithm starts with a masked string, replacing some letters with underscores.</li>
<li>It searches a dictionary to find all possible words matching the pattern. (The length of the word, say)</li>
<li>Then, it analyzes the frequency of letters appearing in these potential words and creates a table to keep track of these frequencies.</li>
<li>Next, it selects the letter with the highest frequency among the remaining unguessed letters as the best guess.</li>
</ol>
<p>I understood the algorithm given above. However, my question is, if I get a random word, <em><strong>not necessarily from the dictionary of words</strong></em>, won't this algorithm fail to work? What is a more efficient method to tackle this broader problem?</p>

Unable to detect gibberish names using Python,"<p>I am trying to build Python model that could classify account names as either legitimate or gibberish. Capitalization is not important in this particular case as some legitimate account names could be comprised of all upper-case or all lower-case letters. </p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer: this is just a internal research/experiment and no real action will be taken on the classifier outcome.</strong> </p>

<p>In my particular, there are 2 possible characteristics that can reveal an account name as suspicious, gibberish or both:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Weird/random spelling in name or name consists of purely or mostly numbers. Examples of account names that fit these criteria are: <strong>128, 127, h4rugz4sx383a6n64hpo, tt, t66, t65, asdfds</strong>.</p></li>
<li><p>The name has 2 components (let's assume that no name will ever have more than 2 components) and the spelling and pronounciation of the 2 components are very similar. Examples of account names that fit these criteria are: <strong>Jala Haja, Hata Yaha, Faja Kaja</strong>.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>If an account name meets both of the above criteria (i.e. 'asdfs lsdfs', '332 333') it should also be considered suspicious.  </p>

<p>On the other hand, a legitimate account name doesn't need to have both first name and last name. They are usually names from popular languages such as Roman/Latin (i.e. Spanish, German, Portuguese, French, English), Chinese, and Japanese. </p>

<p>Examples of legitimate account names include (these names are made up but do reflect similar styles of legitimate account names in real world): <strong>Michael, sara, jose colmenares, Dimitar, Jose Rafael, Morgan, Eduardo Medina, Luis R. Mendez, Hikaru, SELENIA, Zhang Ming, Xuting Liu, Chen Zheng</strong>.</p>

<p>I've seen some slightly similar questions on Stackoverflow that asks for ways to detect gibberish texts. But those don't fit my situation because legitimate texts and words actually have meanings, whereas human names usually don't. I also want to be able to do it just based on account names and nothing else.  </p>

<p>Right now my script takes care of finding the 2nd characteristic of suspicious account names (similar components in name) using Python's Fuzzy Wuzzy package and using 50% as the similarity threshold. The script is listed below:</p>

<pre><code>from fuzzywuzzy import fuzz
from fuzzywuzzy import process

import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

accounts = pd.read_csv('dataset_with_names.csv', encoding = 'ISO-8859-1', sep=None, engine='python').replace(np.nan, 'blank', regex=True)

pd.options.mode.chained_assignment = None

accounts.columns = ['name', 'email', 'akon_id', 'acct_creation_date', 'first_time_city', 'first_time_ip', 'label']

accounts['name_simplified']=accounts['name'].str.replace('[^\w\s]','')
accounts['name_simplified']=accounts['name_simplified'].str.lower()

sim_name = []

for index, row in accounts.iterrows():        
    if ' ' in row['name_simplified']:
        row['name_simplified']=row['name_simplified'].split()
        if len(row['name_simplified']) &gt; 1:
            #print(row['name_simplified'])
            if fuzz.ratio(row['name_simplified'][0], row['name_simplified'][1]) &gt;= 50:
                sim_name.append('True')
            else:
                sim_name.append('False')
        else:
            sim_name.append('False')
    else:
        sim_name.append('False')        

accounts['are_name_components_similar'] = sim_name 
</code></pre>

<p>The result has been reliable for what the script was designed to do, but I also want to be able to surface gibberish account names with the 1st characteristic (weird/random spelling or name consists of purely or mostly numbers). So far I have not found a solution to that yet. </p>

How to download spaCy models in a Poetry managed environment,"<p>I am writing a Python Jupyter notebook that does some NLP processing on Italian texts.</p>

How to turn an adjective into a noun in python (pymorphy2)?,"<p>I have a word in Russian (which is actually where the difficulty arises). It's an adjective. And I need to make it in a noun form.</p>

<p>These are the names of cities. On the left is the form of the word that I get from the data, on the right, the form that I need.</p>

Natural Language Processing for Smart Homes,"<p>I'm writing up a Smart Home software for my bachelor's degree, that will only simulate the actual house, but I'm stuck at the NLP part of the project. The idea is to have the client listen to voice inputs (already done), transform it into text (done) and send it to the server, which does all the heavy lifting / decision making.</p>
<p>So all my inputs will be fairly short (like &quot;please turn on the porch light&quot;). Based on this, I want to take the decision on which object to act, and how to act. So I came up with a few things to do, in order to write up something somewhat efficient.</p>
<ol>
<li>Get rid of unnecessary words (in the previous example &quot;please&quot; and &quot;the&quot; are words that don't change the meaning of what needs to be done; but if I say &quot;turn off <em>my</em> lights&quot;, &quot;my&quot; does have a fairly important meaning).</li>
<li>Deal with synonyms (&quot;turn on lights&quot; should do the same as &quot;enable lights&quot; -- I know it's a stupid example). I'm guessing the only option is to have some kind of a dictionary (XML maybe), and just have a list of possible words for one particular object in the house.</li>
<li>Detecting the verb and subject. &quot;turn on&quot; is the verb, and &quot;lights&quot; is the subject. I need a good way to detect this.</li>
<li>General implementation. How are these things usually developed in terms of algorithms? I only managed to find one article about NLP in Smart Homes, which was very vague (and had bad English). Any links welcome.</li>

What is the most efficient way to identify text similarity between items in large lists of strings in Python?,"<p>The following piece of code achieves the results I'm trying to achieve. There is a list of strings called 'lemmas' that contains the accepted forms of a specific class of words. The other list, called 'forms' contains a lot of spelling variations of words found in a large amount of texts from different periods and different dialects of a specific language. For each one of the words in 'forms', I want to get the string in 'lemmas' that is the closest match.</p>
<p>The script, as I said, seems to work well with some test lists I've constructed. The problem I have, though, is that when I use the real lists, which are rather large, it takes forever to produce the results. In fact, I have had to stop the execution of the program because it was taking already more than two hours and the computer was becoming very slow and I couldn't do anything else.</p>
<p>What could I do to make this more efficient? How would I have to modify the code using other Python tools or libraries to make this faster? Thanks in advance.</p>

<p>This was a HUGE improvement over everything I had tried before. Besides the test with the short lists in the example, I ran it with the actual lists containing around 190,000 strings and the processing time was 118 minutes. While I'm pretty sure this could be improved (one might look for ways to do it using some kind of vectorization - someone suggested using arrays from numpy or AI oriented libraries), for the time being, this is quite manageable. There is still a problem that doesn't have to do with efficiency.</p>
<p>I mention this in my comment to @jqurious below but I will explain it here in more detail. Running the script above with the test list, one gets results like the following:</p>
<pre><code>berate ➝  bezant: 0.5
berate ➝  become: 0.5
</code></pre>
<p>From a linguistic point of view, any English speaker would know that these pairs of words are not related (OK, unless you know about the history of the language and know that be- used to be a productive prefix). What I'm trying to do with this script is to determine what would be the appropriate lemma (the dictionary form or representative word) for all the variants of a particular word found in the texts of a corpus.</p>
<p>This is a diachronic corpus containing many texts from many different authors and from many different dialects of a language writen over a period of more than 5 centuries. A 'u' could often be used instead of 'v' or a 'y' instead of an 'i'. An 'h' can als be often be missing from a word that is spelt with 'h' even in the same text by the same author. The variation is huge and yet even a modern speaker of the languate can usually detect whether the words are related quite easily. Of course, the speaker of the language is knowledgeable about the word structure and the morphology and so can immediately see that, for instance, 'uermellíssima' is related to 'vermell' despite the fact that a lot of characters are different.</p>
<p>Using Kyle's suggestion with the actual lists, I got results like the following:</p>
<pre><code>beato ➝  beat: 0.8
beatriç ➝  tectriu: 0.5714285714285714
beatriç ➝  teatral: 0.5714285714285714
beatte ➝  beats: 0.6666666666666667
beatus ➝  certus: 0.6666666666666667
beatíssim ➝  nequíssim: 0.6666666666666667
beatíssim ➝  gravíssim: 0.6666666666666667
</code></pre>
<p>Even if you don't know the language (medieval Catalan in case anybody is interested), you can see how this is very wrong (using other algorithms like the Levenshtein or the cosine distance it is just hopeless). The lemmas 'beat' or 'beats' should ideally be the ones selected as being the &quot;closest&quot; in all these cases. Yet the algorithm does what it does.</p>
<p>Perhaps I haven't looked hard enough, but with all the work in NLP, I'm surprised there aren't other algorithms that could do better in this kind of scenario. I know this deviates a little bit from the main point in the original question but if anybody can give me some useful advice, I would greatly appreciate it.</p>

How to generate a merge file and a vocab file in NLP field,"<p>I want to use the Megatron framework for Chinese NLP pre-training tasks.

Using spaCy to Lemmatize Korean?,"<p>I'm trying to lemmatize some Korean sentences using some pretrained models.

<p>For the Korean however, the output of this code is providing WORD+affix. I cannot post with Korean due to anti-spam measures but basically it appears to be rather than providing the lemma simply telling me how the word is composed. Am I doing something wrong is this simply how the model works? Is there any way to get the actual base word? Sorry if it's obvious and thanks everyone for the help.</p>

Problem trimming Japanese string in java,"<p>I have the following string (japanese) ""　ユーザー名"" , the first character is ""like"" whitespace but its number in unicode is 12288, so if I do ""　ユーザー名"".trim() I get the same string (trim doesn't work).
If i do trim in c++ it works ok.
Does anyone know how to solve this issue in java?
Is there a special trim method for unicode?</p>

How to generate word embeddings in Portuguese using Gensim?,"<p>I have the following problem:</p>

<p>In English language my code generates successful word embeddings with Gensim, and similar phrases are close to each other considering cosine distance:</p>

<p>It takes too long to wait for all data to arrive and is too frequent to send on every single char arriving, and I need to send proper data segment intermitently.</p>
<pre><code>// initiate an SSE request and receive new data by `onEvent`
eventSourceFactory.newEventSource(request, new EventSourceListener() {
    // onEvent called every time remote send new data, `data` is new data

Transformer is only predicting End of Sequence token during inference,"<h1>Question</h1>

<p>I am trying to code a translator from English to Kannada (a South Indian language). The training seems to happen just fine. However, when trying to infer / translate a given English sentence to Kannada, I just get the <code>END_TOKEN</code> as the translation no matter what the actual English sentence input is. I need assistance to see why this is the case.</p>

The dataset I used is from <a href=""https://paperswithcode.com/paper/samanantar-the-largest-publicly-available"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Samanatar</a>.

"Find n-grams especially common in one corpus vs. another one, and compared to English as a whole","<p>I have two corpuses/documents of survey responses (as columns in Pandas dataframes). I would like to understand which n-grams distinguish one corpus from another, among those n-grams which distinguish those corpuses from the English language as a whole. I would like to find the weird words (jargon) which show up in these documents more often than English.
That is, how did changing the prompt which generated the survey responses, or the week the participants were surveyed, change the content of what they responded? This would be a similar concept to NLP data drift detection. Another way to look at it would be to detect trending n-grams over time.</p>
<p>I would like to do this in Python or R, or perhaps in AWS. Deep learning approaches are fine.</p>
<p>This is not cosine similarity.
This is not the same problem as taking the top 10 words in the corpuses by TF-IDF. That still gives me very common English words, even with stopword removal. Also, that does not compare the two corpuses.</p>

// let string = &quot;we had the meeting last month&quot; // no match found does not work - returns nil

Regex - How can you identify strings which are not words?,"<p>Got an interesting one, and can't come up with any solid ideas, so thought maybe someone else may have done something similar.</p>
<p>I want to be able to identify strings of letters in a longer sentence that are not words and remove them.  Essentially things like <code>kuashdixbkjshakd</code></p>
<p>Everything annoyingly is in lowercase which makes it more difficult, but since I only care about English, I'm essentially looking for the opposite of consonant clusters, groups of them that don't make phonetically pronounceable sounds.</p>
<p>Has anyone heard of/done something like this before?</p>
<p>EDIT: this is what ChatGpt tells me</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is difficult to provide a comprehensive list of combinations of consonants that have never appeared in a word in the English language. The English language is a dynamic and evolving language, and new words are being created all the time. Additionally, there are many regional and dialectal variations of the language, which can result in different sets of words being used in different parts of the world.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>It is also worth noting that the frequency of use of a particular combination of consonants in the English language is difficult to quantify, as the existing literature on the subject is limited. The best way to determine the frequency of use of a particular combination of consonants would be to analyze a large corpus of written or spoken English.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In general, most combinations of consonants are used in some words in the English language, but some combinations of consonants may be relatively rare. Some examples of relatively rare combinations of consonants in English include &quot;xh&quot;, &quot;xw&quot;, &quot;ckq&quot;, and &quot;cqu&quot;. However, it is still possible that some words with these combinations of consonants exist.</p>

Combining a Tokenizer into a Grammar and Parser with NLTK,"<p>I am making my way through the NLTK book and I can't seem to do something that would appear to be a natural first step for building a decent grammar.</p>

<p>My goal is to build a grammar for a particular text corpus. </p>

<p><em>(Initial question: Should I even try to start a grammar from scratch or should I start with a predefined grammar? If I should start with another grammar, which is a good one to start with for English?)</em></p>

<p>Suppose I have the following simple grammar:</p>

<pre><code>simple_grammar = nltk.parse_cfg(""""""
S -&gt; NP VP
PP -&gt; P NP
NP -&gt; Det N | Det N PP
VP -&gt; V NP | VP PP
Det -&gt; 'a' | 'A'
N -&gt; 'car' | 'door'
V -&gt; 'has'
P -&gt; 'in' | 'for'
 """""");
</code></pre>

<p>This grammar can parse a very simple sentence, such as:</p>

<pre><code>parser = nltk.ChartParser(simple_grammar)
trees = parser.nbest_parse(""A car has a door"")
</code></pre>

<p>Now I want to extend this grammar to handle sentences with other nouns and verbs. How do I add those nouns and verbs to my grammar without manually defining them in the grammar? </p>

<p>For example, suppose I want to be able to parse the sentence ""A car has wheels"". I know that the supplied tokenizers can <em>magically</em> figure out which words are verbs/nouns, etc. How can I use the output of the tokenizer to tell the grammar that ""wheels"" is a noun?</p>

Stemmers vs Lemmatizers,"<p>Natural Language Processing (NLP), especially for English, has evolved into the stage where stemming would become an archaic technology if ""perfect"" lemmatizers exist. It's because stemmers change the surface form of a word/token into some meaningless stems. </p>

<p>Then again the definition of the ""perfect"" lemmatizer is questionable because different NLP task would have required different level of lemmatization.

<li><p>If not, then how should we move on to build robust lemmatizers that
can take on <code>nounify</code>, <code>verbify</code>, <code>adjectify</code> and <code>adverbify</code>

Using NLP to process leave absence requests,"<p>I'm developing an online leave management system. The plan is to integrate a Natural Language Processing (NLP) component such that the system can decide whether leave request should be accepted or not. For example:</p>
<p>If someone requests leave for a funeral, the system should give this request a high priority. If someone requests leave for a <em>family</em> funeral, it should get a higher priority relative to the previous funeral leave request. Conversely, if someone requests leave for a simple trip/holiday, the system should assign a lower priority relative to the other leave requests.</p>
<p>I'm using the <code>.net</code> framework and <code>C#</code> programming language. Could someone please suggest how I can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Integrate NLP to understand the leave requests and assign priority to each request</li>
<li>Accept high priority leave requests and reject lower priority leave requests</li>
</ul>

<p>I would like to be able to map these two on the graph above.</p>
<p>In Taranto's case where the NER span equals the word span, I guess I just need to map the NER span onto the right word start and end chars.</p>
<p>In &quot;Ignazio Larussa&quot;'s case things are more tricky, since the NER span encompasses TWO words. So in this case I want to show only ONE node with the NER span &quot;Ignazio Larussa&quot; connected via the nsubj edge to the &quot;disse&quot; verb.</p>

Stanford-NLP Parser incorrectly splits my sentence,"<p>I'm using the Stanford Parser to parse my corpus (for Machine Translation) to constituency trees. I am able to get the parser to work just fine, both through the GUI and the command line, but one problem I'm having is how it basically 'defines a line'.</p>
<p>Usually, when working with a corpus, a sentence is an entire string of words until it reaches a new line. With the Stanford parser, it seems to take a sentence to be up until an 'end-of-sentence character' like a full stop or question mark. In some situations,this ends with incorrectly taking a portion of a sentence to be an entire sentence on its own, which inflates the number of sentences I have and causes misalignment with my target dataset.
Is there any way I can get the parser to take a sentence to be up until the <code>\n</code> newline, or is it just defined this way?</p>

Obtaining data from both token and word objects in a Stanza Document / Sentence,"<p>I am using a Stanford STANZA pipeline on some (italian) text.</p>
<p>Problem I'm grappling with is that I need data from BOTH the Token and Word objects.</p>
<p>While I'm able to access one or the other separately I'm not wrapping my head on how to get data from both in a single loop over the Document -&gt; Sentence</p>
<p>Specifically I need both some Word data (such as lemma, upos and head) but I also need to know the corresponding start and end position, which in my understanding I can find in the token.start_char and token.end_char.</p>

Text segmentation: dictionary-based word splitting,"<h2>Background</h2>

<p>Split database column names into equivalent English text to seed a data dictionary. The English dictionary is created from a corpus of corporate documents, wikis, and email. The dictionary (<code>lexicon.csv</code>) is a CSV file with words and probabilities. Thus, the more often someone writes the word ""therapist"" (in email or on a wiki page) the higher the chance of ""therapistname"" splits to ""therapist name"" as opposed to something else. (The lexicon probably won't even include the word rapist.)</p>

<h2>Problem (updated 2011-01-03)</h2>

<p>When the following problem is encountered:</p>

<pre><code>dependentrelationship::end depend ent dependent relationship
end=0.86
ent=0.001
dependent=0.8
relationship=0.9
</code></pre>

<p>These possible solutions exist:</p>

<pre><code>dependentrelationship::dependent relationship
dependentrelationship::dep end ent relationship
dependentrelationship::depend ent relationship
</code></pre>

<p>The lexicon contains words with their relative probabilities (based on word frequency): <code>dependent 0.8</code>, <code>end 0.86</code>, <code>relationship 0.9</code>, <code>depend 0.3</code>, and <code>ent 0.001</code>.</p>

<p>Eliminate the solution of <code>dep end ent relationship</code> because <code>dep</code> is not in the lexicon (i.e., 75% word usage), whereas the other two solutions cover 100% of words in the lexicon. Of the remaining solutions, the probability of <code>dependent relationship</code> is <em>0.72</em> whereas <code>depend ent relationship</code> is <em>0.00027</em>. We can therefore select <code>dependent relationship</code> as the correct solution.</p>

MT5 machine learning model for paraphrasing,"<p>I'm trying to create a machine learning model to paraphrase given Persian text. I was introduced to mt5 as a multilingual text-to-text model. However, I can't figure out how to implement this. I have gathered the data. Here's a sample of the data:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/qz6MC.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Data sample</a></p>
<p><strong>---UPDATE---</strong></p>
<p>I have tried to paraphrase using the T5 model, and it works well for English. However, I can't get logical results from the MT5 model. Here is the T5 version code:</p>
<pre><code>from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(&quot;Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws&quot;)
model = AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM.from_pretrained(&quot;Vamsi/T5_Paraphrase_Paws&quot;)
</code></pre>
<pre><code>sentence = sentence_1

text =  &quot;paraphrase: &quot; + sentence + &quot; &lt;/s&gt;&quot;

encoding = tokenizer.encode_plus(text,pad_to_max_length=True, return_tensors=&quot;pt&quot;)
input_ids, attention_masks = encoding[&quot;input_ids&quot;], encoding[&quot;attention_mask&quot;]


outputs = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_masks,
    max_length=256,
    do_sample=True,
    top_k=120,
    top_p=0.95,
    early_stopping=False,
    num_return_sequences=5
)

print (&quot;\n&quot;)
print(&quot;Origianl sentence:&quot;)
print(sentence)
print (&quot;\n&quot;)
print(&quot;Paraphrasing:&quot;)

for output in outputs:
    line = tokenizer.decode(output, skip_special_tokens=True,clean_up_tokenization_spaces=True)
    print(line)
</code></pre>
<p>When I give the following sentence to the model, it returns the following results:</p>
<p><em>Original sentence:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Washing your hands Properly will keep you away from COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Paraphrasing:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>By properly washing your hands, you will keep away from COVID-19.</li>
<li>Washing your hands correctly will keep you away from COVID-19.</li>

<li>Washing your hands correctly will keep you from COVID-19.</li>
<li>Washing your hands properly will keep you away from COVID-19.</li>
</ul>
<p>But when I change the model to the MT5-base, the results are absurd. Here is an example:</p>
<pre><code>from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForSeq2SeqLM

Paraphrase recognition using sentence level similarity,"<p>I'm a new entrant to NLP (Natural Language Processing). As a start up project, I'm developing a paraphrase recognizer (a system which can recognize two similar sentences). For that recognizer I'm going to apply various measures at three levels, namely: lexical, syntactic and semantic. At the lexical level, there are multiple similarity measures like cosine similarity, matching coefficient, Jaccard coefficient, et cetera. For these measures I'm using the <code>simMetrics</code> package developed by the University of Sheffield which contains a lot of similarity measures. But for the Levenshtein distance and Jaro-Winkler distance measures, the code is only at <strong>character level</strong>, whereas I require code at the sentence level (i.e. considering a single word as a unit instead of character-wise). Additionally, there is no code for computing the Manhattan distance in <code>SimMetrics</code>. Are there any suggestions for how I could develop the required code (or someone provide me the code) at the sentence level for the above mentioned measures?</p>

How to locate Spacy span from string range?,"<p>I study natural language processing with spaCy and decided to write a pipe that will identify addresses like Dr, Mr, Mrs followed by names as person recognised entity. In the process, I decided to use regular expressions to identify the prefix part, and I found out that whenever I search RE pattern, it returns me the indexes in the whole source text. My task is to extract the addressed names and add them as <code>Span</code> objects, however the constructor demands me to pass a <code>Doc</code> object range.</p>
<p>Is it possible to locate the span in doc for a string position? I could have enumerated through every span individually storing the index as a separate variable and search the regular expression in it, and I will be satisfied with this solution, however is it possible to either translate string position to a span it belongs to or create spans for newly recognised entities in a different way?</p>

Algorithm for keyword/phrase trend search similar to Twitter trends,"<p>Wanted some ideas about building a tool which can scan text sentences (written in english language) and build a keyword rank, based on the most occurrences of words or phrases within the texts. </p>

<p>This would be very similar to the twitter trends wherin twitter detects and reports the top 10 words within the tweets.</p>

<p>I have identified the high level steps in the algorithm as follows  </p>

<ol>
<li>Scan the text and remove all the common , frequent words ( such as, ""the"" , ""is"" , ""are"", ""what"" , ""at"" etc..)</li>
<li>Add the remaining words to a hashmap. If the word is already in the map then increment its count.</li>
<li>To get the top 10 words , iterate through the hashmap and find out the top 10 counts.</li>
</ol>

<p>Step 2 and 3 are straightforward but I do not know in step 1 how do I detect the important words within a text and segregate them from the common words (prepositions, conjunctions etc )</p>

<p>Also if I want to track phrases what could be the approach ?
For example if I have a text saying ""This honey is very good"" 
I might want to track ""honey"" and ""good"" but I may also want to track the phrases ""very good"" or ""honey is very good"" </p>

<p>Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

Using BERT in order to detect language of a given word,"<p>I have words in the Hebrew language. Part of them are originally in English, and part of them are 'Hebrew English', meaning that those are words that are originally from English but are written with Hebrew words. 
For example: 'insulin' in Hebrew is ""אינסולין"" (Same phonetic sound). </p>

<p>I have a simple binary dataset. 
X: words (Written with Hebrew characters)
y: label 1 if the word is originally in English and is written with Hebrew characters, else 0</p>

<p>I've tried using the classifier, but the input for it is full text, and my input is just words. </p>

How to perform word-level alignment between a sentence and its translation?,"<p>I want to align source and target sentences in a multilingual translation setting.</p>

i   saw the man  walking on  the    street

Is there information in a spacy token indicative of the meaning of the token?,"<p>Suppose I have a spacy system and can easily mark a verb or punctuation member as having semantic meaning.</p>

They have changed the way the response is sent and they use partial translations as well which does not work in my app. How do I remove the partial translations and only use the last chunk? I am using C# since the project is in Unity.</p>
<p>In the code snippet attached, the wit.ai checks for every word now. I just want the final result of the entire text. How do I do that?</p>

NLP and spaCy: How to find a similar phrase in a string,"<p>thanks in advance for reading.</p>
<p>I'm in Python and using spaCy for processing English text. I have a phrase that I want to search for</p>
<pre><code>search_phrase = &quot;payment date&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>in a larger phrase</p>
<pre><code>text_to_be_searched = &quot;Party A will pay Party B on the transaction date.&quot;
</code></pre>
<p>And I want the search to match &quot;payment date&quot; with &quot;transaction date&quot; based on similarity.</p>
<p>How can I do this? I don't see an obvious way, and the only thing I can think of is to manually split <code>text_to_be_searched</code> into chunks.  One extra difficulty here is that the matching phrases could have different numbers of tokens, so I'd have to break it into chunks of 1, 2, ... 5 tokens and search each chunk in each set of chunks. For clarity, this would be:</p>
<p>Set of 1-token chunks:</p>
<pre><code>['Party','A','will', ..., 'date']
</code></pre>
<p>Set of 2-token chunks:</p>
<pre><code>['Party A','A will','will pay', ..., 'transaction date']
</code></pre>

What does generate() do when using NLTK in Python?,"<p>I've been working with NLTK for the past three days to get familiar and reading the ""Natural Language processing"" book to understand what's going on. I'm curious if someone could clarify for me the following:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Note that the first time you run this command, it is slow because it
  gathers statistics about word sequences. Each time you run it, you
  will get different output text. Now try generating random text in the
  style of an inaugural address or an Internet chat room. Although the
  text is random, it re-uses common words and phrases from the source
  text and gives us a sense of its style and content. (What is lacking
  in this randomly generated text?)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This part of the text, <a href=""http://nltk.org/book/ch01.html"" rel=""nofollow"">chapter 1,</a> simply says that it ""gathers statistics"" and it will get ""different output text""</p>

<p>What <em>specifically</em> does generate do and how does it work? </p>

<p>This example of <code>generate()</code> uses text3, which is the Bible's Genesis:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the beginning , between me and thee and in the garden thou mayest
  come in unto Noah into the ark , and Mibsam , And said , Is there yet
  any portion or inheritance for us , and make thee as Ephraim and as
  the sand of the dukes that came with her ; and they were come . Also
  he sent forth the dove out of thee , with tabret , and wept upon them
  greatly ; and she conceived , and called their names , by their names
  after the end of the womb ? And he</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Here, the <code>generate()</code> function seems to simply output phrases created by cutting off text at punctuation and randomly reassembling it but it has a bit of readability to it.</p>

words = set(nltk.corpus.words.words())

sent = &quot;I love Matauranga&quot;
&quot; &quot;.join(w for w in nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(sent) \
         if not w.lower() in words or not w.isalpha())
</code></pre>
<p>The result of the above code is <code>'Matauranga'</code> which is perfectly correct.</p>

dummy_df['non_english'] = dummy_df.apply(no_english, axis = 1)
print(dummy_df)

<p>I got an undesirable result in that the <code>non_english</code> column has <code>none</code> value instead of the desired non-english words (see below):</p>
<pre><code>                       outcome non_english

Training transformer model for summarization task with data generated by translation transformer,"<p>I am working on a project and this question popped into my mind. Please enlighten me if that is a wrong way of thinking or if it actually might work.</p>
<p>I have a large dataset of text data in language X but a summarization model pretrained for such language does not exist. However, there are models that are trained to do machine translation from language X to language Y that I could use with my dataset. Then, it would be possible to use a summarization model for language Y and translate the output back to X.</p>
<p>Please tell me if there is something wrong with my idea. I am fairly new to NLP.

How to recognise a particular user in a long multi-user internet chat log?,"<p>Here is an online programming contest we are planning to have. </p>

<p><strong>What could be possible approaches to solving the same?</strong></p>

<p>From a random IRC (Internet Relay Chat) log, a small percentage of the user nicknames will be randomly deleted. The participant’s code must be able to fill in the missing user nicks. In other words, this event requires you to come up with an intelligent program that can figure out “who could have said what”.</p>

<p>It may be assumed that all communication will be in modern English, with or without punctuation.</p>

<p>For example -</p>

<p>Original Chat:
<code>...
&lt;user1&gt;: Hey!
&lt;user2&gt;: Hello! Where are you from, user1?
&lt;user3&gt;: Can anybody help me out with Gnome installation?
&lt;user1&gt;: India. user3, do you have the X Windows System installed?
&lt;user2&gt;: Cool. What is Gnome, user3?
&lt;user3&gt;: I don’t know. How do I check?
&lt;user3&gt;: Its a desktop environment, user2.
&lt;user2&gt;: Oh yeah! Just googled. 
&lt;user1&gt;: Type “startx” on the command line. Login as root and type “apt-get install gnome”.

&lt;user5&gt;: I’m root, obey me!
&lt;user2&gt;: Huh?!

Automatically Add Diacritic/Accent Marks to a Non-English Document,"<p>In my spare time, I am transcribing a very old, rare book written in Romanian (in fact, it is the only remaining copy, to my knowledge). It was written over a hundred years ago, well before any computers existed. As such, no digital copies exist, and I am manually transcribing and digitizing it.</p>
<p>The book is thousands of pages long, and it is surprisingly time consuming (for me, at least) to add diacritic and accented marks (<code>ă/â/î/ş/ţ</code>) to every single word as I type. If I omit the marks and just type the bare letters (i.e <code>a</code> instead of <code>ă/â</code>), I am able to type more than twice as fast, which is a huge benefit. Currently I am typing everything directly into a <code>.tex</code> file to apply special formatting for the pages and illustrations.</p>
<p>However, I know that eventually I will have to add all these marks back into the text, and it seems tedious/unecessary to do all that manually, since I already have all the letters. I'm looking for some way to automatically/semi-automatically <strong>ADD</strong> diacritic/accent marks to a large body of text (<em>not</em> remove - I see plenty of questions asking how to remove the marks on SO).</p>
<p>I tried searching for large corpora of Romanian words (<a href=""https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ManiacDC/TypingAid/master/Wordlists/Wordlist%20Romanian.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> and <a href=""https://github.com/dumitrescustefan/RoWordNet"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> were the most promising two), but everything I found fell short, missing at least a few words on any random sample of text I fed it (I used a short python script). It doesn't help that the book uses many archaic/uncommon words or uncommon spellings of words.</p>
<p>Does anyone have any ideas on how I might go about this? There are no dumb ideas here - any document format, machine learning technique, coding language, professional tool, etc that you can think of that might help is appreciated.</p>
<p>I should also note that I have substantial coding experience, and would not consider it a waste of time to build something myself. Tbh, I think it might be beneficial to the community, since I could not find such a tool in <strong>any</strong> western language (french, czech, serbian, etc). Just need some guidance on how to get started.</p>

How do I use gensim to vectorize these words in my dataframe so I can perform clustering on them?,"<p>I am trying to do a clustering analysis (preferably k-means) of poetry words on a pandas dataframe.

How can I change the white space between spans when adding them programmatically?,"<p>Working on this <a href=""https://github.com/eelegiap/texthighlight"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">text alignment project</a> in D3.js, HTML/CSS, and Javascript.

<p>I've tried doing <code>with open(&quot;get_sg250&quot;, encoding = encoding) as file: file.readlines() </code> for different encodings but it seems like none of them are the answer (utf-8 does not work at all), if I try windows-1256 I get gibberish:</p>

extract all two-character-combinations from a string,"<p>In order to identify nonsense text (e.g. djsarejslslasdfhsl) from real (German) words, I would like to do an analysis of letter-frequencies.</p>
<p>My idea is to calculate the relative frequencies of two-letter-combinations (&quot;te&quot;, &quot;ex&quot;, &quot;xt&quot;, &quot;is&quot; etc.) using a long text. Based on that information I would like to calculate the probability that a given word (or sentence) is real German.</p>
<p>But my first problem is, how to extract all the two-letter-combinations and to count them? I fear that using <code>substring(string, start, stop)</code> and increasing the values of <code>start</code> and <code>stop</code> in a loop might not be a very efficient solution. Do you have any idea?</p>

text &lt;- 'Es ist ein Freudentag – ohne Zweifel. Gesundheitsminister Alain Berset und der Bundesrat gehen weiter, als man annehmen durfte. Die Zertifikatspflicht wird aufgehoben, die Maskenpflicht gilt nur noch im ÖV und in Gesundheitseinrichtungen.
Die beste Meldung des Tages aber ist: Die Covid-19-Task-Force, inzwischen als «Task-Farce» verballhornt, wird auf Ende März aufgehoben – zwei Monaten früher als geplant. Die Dauerkritik war wohl mit ein Grund, dass dieses Gremium sich jetzt rasch auflösen will.
Keine Rosen ohne Dornen: Einzelne Punkte von Bersets Ausführungen geben zu denken.
Die «Isolationshaft» für positiv Getestete bleibt zwingend. Das ist Unsinn und steht in einem scharfen Kontrast zu den übrigen Öffnungsschritten. Die Grundimmunität der Bevölkerung beträgt über 90 Prozent, das Virus ist nicht mehr gefährlich, warum will man weiter Leute zu Hause einsperren? Wer schwer krank ist, geht von sich aus nicht zur Arbeit. Die krankheitsbedingte Bettruhe muss man den Menschen nicht vorschreiben.
Gesundheitsminister Berset findet, das Modell Task-Force habe eine interessante Möglichkeit aufgezeigt für die Zusammenarbeit zwischen Regierung und Wissenschaft. Unter Umständen eigne sich dieses Modell auch für andere Bereiche.
Nein danke, Herr Berset.
Die Task-Force war mit ihrem öffentlichen Dauer-Alarmismus und ihren haarsträubenden Falsch-Prognosen vor allem eine Manipulationsmaschine.
Und dann noch dies: Irgendwann während der heutigen Pressekonferenz gab Alain Berset zu verstehen, man habe mit all diesen Massnahmen die Bevölkerung schützen wollen. Vielleicht hatte man diese hehre Absicht einmal im Hinterkopf. Alle Massnahmen ab der zweiten Welle erfolgten nicht zum Schutz der Bevölkerung, sondern, um einen Zusammenbruch des Spital-Systems zu verhindern.
Doch jetzt stossen wir erst einmal auf das Ende der Apartheit an.'

Natural Language Processing - Returning results as JSON objects,"<p>I am working on completing a Python programing challenge to do with Natural Language Processing and scraping information from BBC News articles. My previous submission of code (shown below) was marked and failed due to not passing the test criteria (shown below). However I am unable to think of any way to make my code pass the test.</p>
<p>From what I can tell the code is failing for a few reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Escape characters not matching the test code</li>
<li>Use of &quot;      &quot; instead of '   ' in some variables</li>
</ul>
<p>This is my code:</p>

She said the discovery of the risen Christ on the first Easter Day gave his followers new hope and fresh purpose, adding that we could all take heart from this.  Wishing everyone of all faiths and denominations a blessed Easter, she said: &quot;May the living flame of the Easter hope be a steady guide as we face the future.&quot; The Queen, 93, recorded the audio message in the White Drawing Room at Windsor Castle, with one sound engineer in the next room.  The Palace described it as &quot;Her Majesty\'s contribution to those who are celebrating Easter privately&quot;.

</code></pre>

<p>Looking at the <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.metrics.html#nltk.metrics.association.NgramAssocMeasures"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">docs</a>, it looks like the likelihood ratio printed next to each bigram is from</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""Scores ngrams using likelihood ratios as in Manning and Schutze
  5.3.4.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Referring to <a href=""https://nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/promo/colloc.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this article</a>, which states on pg. 22:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One advantage of likelihood ratios is that they have a clear intuitive
  interpretation. For example, the bigram powerful computers is
  e^(.5*82.96) = 1.3*10^18 times more likely under the hypothesis that
  computers is more likely to follow powerful than its base rate of
  occurrence would suggest. This number is easier to interpret than the
  scores of the t test or the 2 test which we have to look up in a
  table.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What I'm confused about is what would be the ""base rate of occurence"" in the event that I'm using the <code>nltk</code> code noted above with my own data. Would it be safe to say, for example, that ""game"" is 32 times more likely to appear next to ""baseball"" in the current dataset than in the average use of the standard English language? Or is it that ""game"" is more likely to appear next to ""baseball"" than other words appearing next to ""baseball"" within the <em>same</em> set of data?</p>

<p>Any help/guidance towards a clearer interpretation or example is much appreciated!</p>

How to add temporal variables to first-order logic formulas?,"<p>I've written an English parser in Prolog that uses first-order logic .</p>
<p>I now want to extend  this parser so that it's
able to tell whether a sentence is in the past, present or future.</p>
<p>In other words, I want my English grammar parser to be able to parse a sentence into a first-order logic formula that contains tense/temporal variables</p>
<p>For example :</p>
<p>The sentence <code>Bill slept.</code> should  be parsed as <code>some(T,and(before(T,now),sleep(bill,T))).</code></p>
<p>And ambigue  example sentences like <code>Every mother loves a child.</code> should still have several possible parsings :</p>
<p><code>- some(T,and(eq(T,now), all(X,imp(mother(X),some(Y,and(child(Y),loves(X,Y))))))).</code>
<code>- some(T,and(eq(T,now), some(X,and(child(X),all(Y,imp(mother(Y),loves(Y,X))))))).</code></p>
<p>However, currently I don't really know how to approach the extension of the first-order logic-formulas with the needed temporal variables.</p>
<p>Therefore my question is if anyone here knows and could point me towards any resources  regarding the extension of first-order logic formulas with temportal variables, or kows about any parsers written in Prolog that can handle tense?</p>
<p>Here is my grammar and parts of the lexicon that are relevant for the example sentences:</p>

Finding contradictory semantic sentences through natural language processing,"<p>I'm working on a project that aims to find conflicting <strong>Semantic Sentences</strong> (<strong>NLP - Semantic Search</strong> )

Is it possible to check if a short sequence of text is random or not?,"<p>Is it possible to check if a short sequence of text, e.g. two or three words, is random or not?
My first thought was to calculate the entropy on the string.</p>

<pre><code>H(""hello world"") = 2.84535
H(""sdzfjksher"") = 3.12193
</code></pre>

<p>but any combination of the chars in <code>""hello world""</code> will result in the same entropy, but will create a random string like <code>""llloo ehrdw""</code>. Entropy based methods works great on long strings like text. Here you can also count single chars to determinate that its a language. You can also use Zipfs Law here to check for real languages...</p>

<p>the next method would be a lookup table of common words, like a normal english dictionary. The problem with this method is to create a list of words first.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>input string        result
------------------------------------------------------
""hello world""       matches 2 words
""helloworld""        random string
""lllooehrdw""        random string
""hello.world""       probably 2 words 
""a.be.was""          probably 3 words (but this is probably a strange edge case)
</code></pre>

<p>So its all about finding words here to compare them with your wordlist, which can be really hard. </p>

<p>Another problem with all these methods could be, that they only detect certain languages or need to be trained to a certain language. Consider that we only want to use english for now.</p>

<p>So is there any good method to do this, or do i need to accept False Positives and False Negatives?</p>

What is the equivalent of Google&#39;s Dialogflow&#39;s `@sys.date-period` if you&#39;re using Actions Console?,"<p>I'm struggling to come to grips with the differences in Google's natural language processing tools. It seems <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dialogflow"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Dialogflow</a> was the original purchase but now Google appears to be egging people on to the &quot;Actions Console&quot;. I'm not even sure if this is a correct statement because the internet is littered with so many different Google tools and one never quite knows which one is current, recommended, or perhaps deprecated.</p>
<p>Anyhow, my concern is how to get &quot;date intervals&quot;. For example, my application wants to say:</p>
<p><em>&quot;How much money did I spend on fuel in December?&quot;</em></p>
<p>by implication I need a start date and an end date.</p>
<p>In Google's Dialowflow's lingo it appears we are fishing for a <strong>System Entity</strong>, Date and Time, called <a href=""https://cloud.google.com/dialogflow/es/docs/reference/system-entities"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>@sys.date.date-period</code></a>. This matches a date interval. This is perfect for my use-case, yet from what I understand Dialogflow is outdated.</p>
<p>In contrast the modern &quot;modern&quot; tool called <strong>Actions on Google</strong> or something by that name has this concept a conversational type variable called <a href=""https://developers.google.com/assistant/conversational/types"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><code>actions.type.DateTime</code></a></p>
<p>In contrast to Dialogflow, Actions on Google seems highly limited. A screenshot of the system types are below:</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/vuKBx.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/vuKBx.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>What am I missing? Are the tools just so different and I should rather be using Dialogflow? Is &quot;Actions on Google&quot; just so new that I started with the wrong tool? Any way of migrating from &quot;Actions on Google&quot; to Dialogflow, or is this a one way street?</p>

Python - How to loop through each index position in a list?,"<p>Given a list <code>[[[&quot;source1&quot;], [&quot;target1&quot;], [&quot;alignment1&quot;]], [&quot;source2&quot;], [&quot;target2&quot;], [&quot;alignment2&quot;]], ...]</code> , I want to extract the words in the source that align with the words in the target.
For example, in the English-German sentence pair <em>The hat is on the table . - Der Hut liegt auf dem Tisch .</em>, I want to print the following:</p>
<pre><code>The - Der
hat - Hut
is - liegt
on - auf
the - dem
table - Tisch
. - . 
</code></pre>
<p>So I have written the following:</p>
<pre><code>en_de = [
[['The', 'hat', 'is', 'on', 'the', 'table', '.'], ['Der', 'Hut', 'liegt', 'auf', 'dem', 'Tisch', '.'], '0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-6'], 
[['The', 'picture', 'is', 'on', 'the', 'wall', '.'], ['Das', 'Bild', 'hängt', 'an', 'der', 'Wand', '.'], '0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-6'], 
[['The', 'bottle', 'is', 'under', 'the', 'sink', '.'], ['Die', 'Flasche', 'ist', 'under', 'dem', 'Waschbecken', '.'], '0-0 1-1 2-2 3-3 4-4 5-5 6-6']
]

for group in en_de:
    src_sent = group[0]
    tgt_sent = group[1]
    aligns = group[2]

    split_aligns = aligns.split()

    hyphen_split = [align.split(&quot;-&quot;) for align in split_aligns]

    align_index = hyphen_split[0]

    print(src_sent[int(align_index[0])],&quot;-&quot;, tgt_sent[int(align_index[1])])
</code></pre>
<p>This prints, as expected, the words in index position 0 of <code>src_sent</code> and <code>tgt_sent</code>:</p>
<pre><code>The - Der
The - Das
The - Die
</code></pre>
<p>Now, I don't know how I can print the words of all index positions of <code>src_sent</code> and <code>tgt_sent</code>. Obviously, I could manually update <code>align_index</code> to a new index position for each position in the sentence pair, but on the full dataset, some sentences will have up to 25 index positions.
Is there a way to possibly for-loop through each index position?
When I try:</p>
<pre><code>align_index = hyphen_split[0:]
print(src_sent[int(align_index[0])],&quot;-&quot;, tgt_sent[int(align_index[1])])
</code></pre>
<p>I get a <code>TypeError:  int() argument must be a string, a bytes-like object or a number, not 'list'</code>
It's clear that <code>align_index</code> can't be a list, but I'm not sure how to convert it into something that will do what I want it to do.
Any advice or help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.</p>

Why won&#39;t my program filter out stop words and punctuation as I programmed it to do?

Then, we have to print out a list of the most common words and their frequencies from that filtered list.

Tokenisation with Spacy - how to get left and right tokens,"<p>I am using Spacy for text tokenization and getting stuck with it:</p>

<pre><code>import spacy

for token in doc:
    print(token.text, token.lemma_, token.pos_, token.tag_, token.dep_, token.shape_, token.is_alpha, token.is_stop)

<p>The &quot;Text&quot; Column has a string of text that may be just a few words (in the case of a forum post) or it may a portion of a novel and have tens of thousands of words (as in the two first rows above).</p>
<p>I have code that constructs the dataframe from various corpus files (.txt and .json), then cleans the text and saves the cleaned dataframe as a pickle file.</p>
<p>I'm trying to run the following code to analyze how variable the spelling of different words are in the corpus. The functions seem simple enough: One counts the occurrence of a particular spelling variable in each Text row; the other takes a list of such frequencies and computes a Gini Coefficient for each lemma (which is just a numerical measure of how heterogenous the spelling is). It references a spelling_var dictionary that has a lemma as its key and the various ways of spelling that lemma as values. (like {'color': ['color', 'colour']} except not in English.)</p>
<p>This code works, but it uses a lot of CPU time. I'm not sure how much, but I use PythonAnywhere for my coding and this code sends me into the tarpit (in other words, it makes me exceed my daily allowance of CPU seconds).</p>
<p>Is there a way to do this so that it's less CPU intensive? Preferably without me having to learn another package (I've spent the past several weeks learning Pandas and am liking it, and need to just get on with my analysis). Once I have the code and have finished collecting the corpus, I'll only run it a few times; I won't be running it everyday or anything (in case that matters).</p>
<p>Here's the code:</p>
<pre><code>import pickle
import pandas as pd
import re

with open('1_raw_df.pkl', 'rb') as pickle_file:
    df = pickle.load(pickle_file)

spelling_var = {
    'illi': [&quot;الي&quot;, &quot;اللي&quot;],
    'besh': [&quot;باش&quot;, &quot;بش&quot;],
    ...
    }

spelling_df = df.copy()

def count_word(df, word):
    pattern = r&quot;\b&quot; + re.escape(word) + r&quot;\b&quot;
    return df['Text'].str.count(pattern)

def compute_gini(freq_list):
    proportions = [f/sum(freq_list) for f in freq_list]
    squared = [p**2 for p in proportions]
    return 1-sum(squared)

for w, var in spelling_var.items():
    count_list = []
    for v in var:
        count_list.append(count_word(spelling_df, v))
        gini = compute_gini(count_list)

Are there good ways to reduce the size of a vocabulary in natural language processing?,"<p>While working on tasks like text classification, QA, the original vocabulary generated from the corpus is usually too large, containing a lot of 'unimportant' words. The most popular ways I've seen to reduce the vocabulary size are discarding stop words and words with low frequencies.</p>

<p>For example, in <code>gensim</code></p>

<pre><code>gensim.utils.prune_vocab(vocab, min_reduce, trim_rule=None):
    Remove all entries from the vocab dictionary with count smaller than min_reduce.
    Modifies vocab in place, returns the sum of all counts that were pruned.
</code></pre>

<p>But in practice, setting the minimum count is empirical and does not seems quite exact. I notice that the term frequency of each word in the vocabulary often follows long-tail distribution, is it a good way if I only keep the top-K words that occupies X% (95%, 90%, 85%, ...) of the total term frequency? Or are there any sensible ways to reduce the vocabulary, without seriously influencing the NLP task? </p>

<p>This will allow me to find which records are similar to each other by comparing how similar the records are. I think I need to use some NLP Models here, as the rows contain textual as well as numerical data.</p>
<p>Is there a way in Python to do this? Some people suggest using dedupe, but due to privacy laws at place in my organization, we can only have in-house capacity for the same. Any suggestions would be welcome.</p>

Data PreProcessing for BERT (base-german),"<p>I am working on a sentiment analysis solution with BERT to analyze tweets in german. My training dataset of is a class of 1000 tweets, which have been manually annotated into the classes neutral, positive and negative.</p>
<p>The dataset with 10.000 tweets is quite unevenly distributed:</p>
<p>approx.
3000 positive
2000 negative
5000 neutral</p>
<p>the tweets contain formulations with @names, https links, numbers, punctuation marks, smileys like :3 :D :) etc..</p>
<p>The interesting thing is, if I remove them with the following code during Data Cleaning, the F1 score gets worse. Only the removal of https links (if I do it alone) leads to a small improvement.</p>
<pre><code># removing the punctuation and numbers
def remove_punct(text):
    text = re.sub(r'http\S+', '', text)                                         # removing links
    text = re.sub(r'@\S+', '', text)                                            # removing referencing on usernames with @
    text = re.sub(r':\S+', '', text)                                            # removing smileys with : (like :),:D,:( etc) 
    text  = &quot;&quot;.join([char for char in text if char not in string.punctuation])
    text = re.sub('[0-9]+', '', text)
    return text

data['Tweet_clean'] = data['Tweet'].apply(lambda x: remove_punct(x))            # extending the dataset with the column tweet_clean
data.head(40)
</code></pre>
<p>also steps like stop words removal or lemmitazation lead more to a deterioration. Is this because I do something wrong or can the model BERT actually handle such values?</p>
<p>A second question is:</p>
<p>I found other records that were also manually annotated, but these are not tweets and the structure of the sentences and language use is different. Would you still recommend to add these records to my original?</p>
<p>There are about 3000 records in German.</p>
<p>My last question:</p>
<p>Should I reduce the class sizes to the size of the smallest unit and thus balance?</p>

Apache Tika fails to detect language on short sentence. Why?,"<p>I tried to detect language on short phrase and was surprised as detection result is wrong. </p>

How can I prevent words with hyphens from being tokenized when using scikit-learn`s term document matrix?,"<p>I am currently working with a large corpus of articles (around 205 thousand), which require the construction of a term document matrix.</p>
<p>I have looked around and it seems that sklearn offers an efficient way to construct it. However, when applying the proposed code to a small list of documents (as a test), I find out that words containing hyphens are divided, with the hyphens as delimiters. This is not desirable, as I am working with documents in Portuguese, in which hyphens are very common due to the large number of compound nouns. I would like to find out how I can generate a term document matrix that simply contains, as coluns, all tokens of my corpus, in which only empty spaces are used as delimiters between tokens (if a word contains a hyphen, it should be considered as a single token).</p>
<p>Here is the code:</p>
<pre><code>index=['doc 1','doc 2','doc 3','doc 4']
docs=['como você está', 'guarda-chuva!','covid-19 piorou','teto-de-gastos do tesouro']

df = pd.DataFrame(list(zip(index, docs)))
df.columns = ['index', 'docs']

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import CountVectorizer
vect = CountVectorizer()  
vects = vect.fit_transform(df.docs)
td = pd.DataFrame(vects.todense()).iloc[:len(df)]  
td.columns = vect.get_feature_names()
term_document_matrix = td.T
term_document_matrix.columns = ['Doc '+str(i) for i in range(1, len(df)+1)]
term_document_matrix['total_count'] = term_document_matrix.sum(axis=1)
</code></pre>
<p>When printing the matrix, I find that “teto-de-gastos” was transformed into “teto”,”de”,”gastos”, which I do not want. Any suggestions on how to fix this hyphen issue?</p>

Remove special characters but not accented letters,"<p>I do the following:</p>

<pre><code>re.sub(r'[^ \nA-Za-z0-9/]+', '', document)
</code></pre>

<p>to remove every character which is not alphanumeric, space, newline, or forward slash.</p>

<p>So I basically I want to remove all special characters except for the newline and the forward slash.</p>

<p>However, I do not want to remove the accented letters which various languages have such as in French, German etc.</p>

<p>But if I run the code above then for example the word </p>

<p><code>Motörhead</code> </p>

<p>becomes </p>

<p><code>Motrhead</code> </p>

<p>and I do not want to do this.</p>

Type-Token Ratio in Google Sheets: How to manipulate long strings of text (millions of characters),"<p>Here’s the challenge. In a Google Sheets spreadsheet, I have a column in which can be found a range of cells containing lists of words separated by comas, one per row, up to a thousand row. Each list show the words taken from a text, in alpha-numeral order, from a few hundred to a few thousand words. I need to count both the total of words in all the rows, taken together, and the number of unique word forms too. In other words, from the glossary of natural language processing, I want to know the number of <em>tokens</em> and the number of <em>types</em> in my corpus, in order to calculate the <em>type-token ratio</em> or lexical density.</p>
<p>In particular, finding the number of unique word forms in the whole column have proven to be a challenge. In an ARRAY FORMULA, with corresponding functions, I’ve JOINED the strings, SPLITED the words, TRANSPOSED them, then removed duplicates with UNIQUE function, then counted the remaining word forms. This worked on a sample corpus constituted of a little over ten lists of words, but failed when I reached fifteen or so lists of words taken together, a far cry from the thousand lists I need to join in my formula to obtain the results I am looking for.</p>
<p>From what I can gather, the problem would reside in that the resulting string I intend to manipulate is exceeding 50,000 characters. Here and there, for specific cases, I’ve found similar questions, and propositions for workarounds, mostly through custom functions, but I could not replicate the result. Needless to say, writing custom fonctions on my own is beyond my reach. Someone suggests to use QUERY headers, but I did not figured either if this was of any help in my case.</p>
<p>The formulas I came up with are the following:</p>
<p>To obtain the total number of words (tokens) through all the lists:
<code>=COUNTA(ARRAYFORMULA(SPLIT(JOIN(&quot;,&quot;;1;B2:B);&quot;,&quot;)))</code></p>
<p>To obtain the number of unique word forms (types) through all the lists:
<code>=COUNTA(ARRAYFORMULA(UNIQUE(TRANSPOSE(SPLIT(JOIN(&quot;,&quot;;1;B2:B);&quot;,&quot;)))))</code></p>

<p>When the translator gets to a verb it adds it to <code>verbo</code> and a preposition to <code>prepo2</code> (it's <code>prepo2</code> not <code>prepo</code> for other reasons). After it finishes translating word for word, it splits it by all translations of <code>the</code> (<code>de</code> and <code>di</code>) and the verb, previously defined <code>verbo</code>. It then should put the verb on the end and go on to run for a preposition instead of a verb, and then put that on the end.</p>

Converting an English Statement into a Questi0n,"<p>(Apologies for the title. Stack overflow doesn't allow the word ""Question"" in titles.)</p>

<p>How would one go about writing an algorithm to convert an english statement into a question? Where would one even begin? For example:</p>

<pre><code>'''Alan Smithee''' steht als [[Pseudonym]] für einen fiktiven Regisseur, der Filme verantwortet, bei denen der eigentliche [[Regisseur]] seinen Namen nicht mit dem Werk in Verbindung gebracht haben möchte. Von 1968 bis 2000 wurde es von der [[Directors Guild of America]] (DGA) für solche Situationen empfohlen, seither ist es '''Thomas Lee'''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Angeles Times|latimes]].com: [http://articles.latimes.com/2000/jan/15/entertainment/ca-54271 ''Name of Director Smithee Isn't What It Used to Be''], zuletzt geprüft am 2. April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alan Smithee'' ist jedoch weiterhin in Gebrauch.

Alternative Schreibweisen sind unter anderem die Ursprungsvariante ''Al'''len''' Smithee'' sowie ''Alan Sm'''y'''thee'' und ''A'''dam''' Smithee''. Auch zwei teilweise asiatisch anmutende Schreibweisen ''Alan Smi Thee'' und ''Sumishii Aran'' gehören – so die [[Internet Movie Database]] – dazu.&lt;ref name=&quot;IMDb&quot;&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/ Eigener Eintrag für ''Alan Smithee'' in der IMDb]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geschichte ==
=== Entstehung ===
Das Pseudonym entstand 1968 infolge der Arbeiten am Western-Film ''Death of a Gunfighter'' (deutscher Titel ''[[Frank Patch – Deine Stunden sind gezählt]]''). Regisseur [[Robert Totten]] und Hauptdarsteller [[Richard Widmark]] gerieten in einen Streit, woraufhin [[Don Siegel]] als neuer Regisseur eingesetzt wurde.

Der Film trug nach Abschluss der Arbeiten noch deutlich Tottens [[Manier (Stil)|Handschrift]], der auch mehr Drehtage als Siegel daran gearbeitet hatte, weshalb dieser die Nennung seines Namens als Regisseur ablehnte. Totten selbst lehnte aber ebenfalls ab. Als Lösung wurde  ''Allen Smithee'' als ein möglichst einzigartiger Name gewählt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0000647/bio ''Biography for Alan Smithee''] in der Internet Movie Database&lt;/ref&gt;

In den zeitgenössischen Kritiken wurde der Regisseur u.&amp;nbsp;a. von [[Roger Ebert]] mit den Worten gelobt: 
{{Zitat
 |Text=Director Allen Smithee, a name I’m not familiar with, allows his story to unfold naturally. He never preaches, and he never lingers on the obvious. His characters do what they have to do.&lt;ref&gt;rogerebert.[[Chicago Sun-Times|suntimes]].com: [https://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/death-of-a-gunfighter-1969 ''Death of a Gunfighter''], zuletzt geprüft am 2. April 2011&lt;/ref&gt;
 |Sprache=en
 |Übersetzung=Regisseur Alan Smithee, ein Name, der mir nicht vertraut ist, erlaubt es seiner Handlung, sich natürlich zu entfalten. Er predigt niemals, und er verweilt nie beim Offensichtlichen. Seine Charaktere tun, was sie tun müssen.}}

=== Aufdeckung und Abkehr ===
1997 kam die Parodie ''An Alan Smithee Film: Burn Hollywood Burn'' (deutscher Titel ''[[Fahr zur Hölle Hollywood]]'') in die Kinos, was das Pseudonym einem größeren Publikum bekannt machte, nicht zuletzt weil [[Arthur Hiller (Regisseur)|Arthur Hiller]], der eigentliche Regisseur des Films, selbst seinen Namen zurückzog und analog zum Filmtitel das Pseudonym ''Alan Smithee'' benutzte. Der Film gilt als einer der schlechtesten Filme der 1990er Jahre und gewann fünf [[Goldene Himbeere]]n.

Der Film ''[[Supernova (2000)|Supernova]]'' ist der erste Post-Smithee-Film, dort führte ein gewisser ''Thomas Lee'' alias [[Walter Hill]] die Regie.
&lt;!-- fand nur einen für den von 1990, siehe ''[[Das Kindermädchen]]'':
„Smithee wurde allerdings auch nach ''Supernova'' gesichtet, in einem Film namens ''The Guardian''.“
--&gt;

== Verwendung ==
Die Verwendung dieses oder eines anderen Pseudonyms ist für Mitglieder der DGA streng reglementiert. Ein Regisseur, der für einen von ihm gedrehten Film seinen Namen nicht hergeben möchte, hat nach Sichtung des fertigen Films drei Tage Zeit, anzuzeigen, dass er ein Pseudonym verwenden möchte. Der Rat der DGA entscheidet binnen zwei Tagen über das Anliegen. Erhebt die Produktionsfirma Einspruch, entscheidet ein Komitee aus Mitgliedern der DGA und der Vereinigung der Film- und Fernsehproduzenten, ob der Regisseur ein Pseudonym angeben darf. Über die Beantragung muss der Regisseur Stillschweigen halten, ebenso darf er den fertigen Film nicht öffentlich kritisieren, wenn die DGA ihm die Verwendung eines Pseudonyms zugesteht.&lt;ref&gt;Siehe zu diesen Regelungen [http://www.dga.org/~/media/Files/Contracts/Agreements/2008%20BA/008ba2008article8.pdf Artikel 8, Abschnitt 8-211 des ''Basic Agreement''] (PDF; 125&amp;nbsp;kB) der DGA von 2008, abgerufen am 25. April 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Ein Antrag des Regisseurs auf Pseudonymisierung kann abgelehnt werden, so durfte [[Tony Kaye (Regisseur)|Tony Kaye]] den Namen Smithee bei dem Film ''[[American History X]]'' nicht einsetzen, obwohl er den Antrag stellte.

Auch bei nicht-US-amerikanischen Produktionen wird der Name verwendet, wie etwa beim [[Pilotfilm]] der Fernsehserie ''[[Schulmädchen (Fernsehserie)|Schulmädchen]]''. 2007 sendete die ARD am 8. und 9. August den zweiteiligen TV-Film ''Paparazzo''. Auch in diesem Werk erscheint anstatt des eigentlichen Regisseurs [[Stephan Wagner (Regisseur)|Stephan Wagner]] Alan Smithee im Abspann.

Regisseure, die das Pseudonym benutzt haben:
* [[Don Siegel]] und [[Robert Totten]] (für ''[[Frank Patch – Deine Stunden sind gezählt]]'')
* [[David Lynch]] (für die dreistündige Fernsehfassung von ''[[Der Wüstenplanet (Film)|Der Wüstenplanet]]'')
* [[Chris Christensen]] (''The Omega Imperative'')
* [[Gianni Bozzacchi]] (für ''I Love N.Y.'')
* [[Stuart Rosenberg]] (für ''Let’s Get Harry'')
* [[Richard C. Sarafian]] (für ''[[Starfire]]'')
* [[Dennis Hopper]] (für ''[[Catchfire]]'')
* [[Arthur Hiller (Regisseur)|Arthur Hiller]] (für ''[[Fahr zur Hölle Hollywood]]'')
* [[Rick Rosenthal]] (''Die Vögel II – Die Rückkehr'')
* [[Kevin Yagher]] (''[[Hellraiser IV – Bloodline]]'')
* [[William Lustig]] (''[[Maniac Cop 3]]'')

Detect Tense in German Sentence (with SpaCy),"<p>I would like to (programmatically) detect the tense (and mood) of German sentences, preferably with SpaCy. I am able to find the root in the sentence and to determine whether it is a finite verb or not. However, Searching SpaCy's documentation I didn't find a solution to determine the tense. Is this possible with SpaCy, or do I need to create my own solution for this?</p>
<p>If it is possible with SpaCy, how?</p>
<p>If not, what would be a good approach to do this? My first approach would be to discriminate between Perfekt and Plusquamperfekt tense based on the existence of a participle verb form, and to identify Futur by checking if the root is a form of werden and the existence of a dependent infinite verb form, with some extra logic to check for Futur II, analogue to checking for Plusquamperfekt. For discrimination of Präteritum against Präsens I would think of doing a look-up in a verb table. Is that a good idea, or is there a better approach, maybe a prebuilt tool?</p>

count the occurrences of POS tagging pattern,"<p>So I've applied POS tagging to one of the columns in my dataframe. For each sentence, I want to count the occurrences of this pattern: NNP, MD, VB.</p>
<p>For example, I have the following sentence:
communications between the Principal and the Contractor shall be in the English language</p>
<p>The POS tagging would be:
(communications, NNS), (between,IN), (the, DT), (Principal, NNP), (and, CC), (the, DT), <strong>(Contractor, NNP), (shall, MD), (be,VB)</strong>, (in, DT), (the, DT), (English, JJ), (language, NN).</p>
<p>Notice that in the POS tagging result, the pattern (NNP, MD, VB) exists and occurs 1 time. I'd like to create a new column in the df for this number of occurrences.</p>
<p>Any ideas how I can do this?</p>

Measuring co-occurence patterns in media articles over time with Quanteda,"<p>I am trying to measure the number of times that different words co-occur with a particular term in collections of Chinese newspaper articles from each quarter of a year.

<li>Group the articles by quarter.</li>
<li>Produce a frequency co-occurence matrix (FCM) for the articles in each quarter (Function 1).</li>
<li>Take the column from this matrix for the 'term' I am interested in and convert this to a data.frame (Function 2)</li>
<li>Merge the data.frames for each quarter together, then produce a large csv file with a column for each quarter and a row for each co-occurring term.</li>

This usually happens when spaCy calls `nlp.create_pipe` with a component name that's not built in - for example, when constructing the pipeline from a model's meta.json. If you're using a custom component, you can write to `Language.factories['tok2vec']` or remove it from the model meta and add it via `nlp.add_pipe` instead.&quot;

Greek alphabet being converted to unicode in dataframe? any packages to support use of different alphabets?,"<p>I created a column containing Greek words, e.g:</p>
<p><code>vocab&lt;-c(&quot;να&quot;, &quot;το&quot;,&quot;δεν&quot;, &quot;είναι&quot;)</code>
however, when shown in a data frame these words are shown as:</p>
<p>&quot;㯚, tο, deν, eί㯚ι &quot; respectivley.</p>
<p>Are there any packages that help R cope with the use of foreign alphabets and treat them the same as they would the standard English one? I don't really understand why they don't automatically treat these symbols as normal English letters.</p>
<p>Thanks for your help!</p>

Predicting correct match of French to English food descriptions,"<p>I have a training and test set of food descriptions pairs (please, see example below)
First name in a pair is a name of food in French
and second word is this food description in English.
Training set has also a <code>trans</code> field that is True for correct descriptions
and False for wrong descriptions.
The task is to predict <code>trans</code> field in a test set, in other words to predict
which food description is correct and which is wrong.</p>

<ul>
<li>Which embeddings to use and how concatenate them?</li>
<li>Any other ideas on approach to this problem? BERT?</li>
</ul>

<p>How about the following approach:</p>
<ul>
<li>Translate (with BERT?) French names to English</li>
<li>Use embeddings to create two vectors: v1 - translated English vector and v2 - English description vector (from data set)</li>
<li>Compute v1 - v2</li>
<li>Create new data set with two columns: <code>v1 - v2</code> and <code>trans</code></li>
<li>Train classifier on this new data set</li>

Removing from a text sequences of items from a list,"<p>I'm conducting research on code-switching. I have a collection of bilingual Polish text messages with English code-switches (say, corpus A) as well as an English dictionary (also a list, corpus B). I wanted to extract from corpus A all instances of words from corpus B - this way I could see which English words appeared in the bilingual corpus. This is the code I used to create a list of these common words (it's far from elegant, but I'm a novice, so don't be too harsh on me haha):</p>
<pre><code>
intersection=common.intersection(corpusB)

commonlist=list(intersection)

<p>However, I noticed that a large portion of my data is skewed because it contains words that are irrelevant to my research. For example, some text messages had large blocks of English text (e.g. copy-pasted paragraphs of English articles - so not really code-switching but quotations). So I'd like to get rid of all of these large blocks of English text from corpus A.</p>
<p>What I thought I should do was locate and delete any text messages that include, say, five English words in a sequence (these would be my big chunks of English text). In other words, I want to scan corpus A for messages that include four adjacent words from corpus B. How can I go about doing that?</p>

<strong>Common noun</strong>
A common noun is a noun that refers to people or things in general, e.g. boy, country, bridge, city, birth, day, happiness.</p>

<p><strong>Proper noun</strong>
A proper noun is a name that identifies a particular person, place, or thing, e.g. Steven, Africa, London, Monday. In written English, proper nouns begin with capital letters.</p>

<p><strong>Concrete noun</strong>
A concrete noun is a noun which refers to people and to things that exist physically and can be seen, touched, smelled, heard, or tasted. Examples include dog, building, coffee, tree, rain, beach, tune.</p>

<p><strong>Abstract noun</strong>
An abstract noun is a noun which refers to ideas, qualities, and conditions - things that cannot be seen or touched and things which have no physical reality, e.g. truth, danger, happiness, time, friendship, humour.</p>

<p><strong>Collective nouns</strong>
Collective nouns refer to groups of people or things, e.g. audience, family, government, team, jury. In American English, most collective nouns are treated as singular, with a singular verb: The whole family was at the table.</p>

Detecting syllables in a word,"<p>I need to find a fairly efficient  way to detect syllables in a word. E.g.,</p>

CVC
CCV
CCCV
CVCC</p>

<p>Pronunciation (5 Pro-nun-ci-a-tion; CV-CVC-CV-V-CVC)</p>

Identifying languages of individual words within list,"<p>Suppose I have a list of words in different languages and I need to sort the words by language. What would be the most efficient way to do this? Currently I am using Python's <a href=""https://pypi.org/project/langdetect/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">langdetect</a> which is very good at identifying individual words of unique character sets. For example '这是什么' has a &gt; 0.99 probability of being Mandarin and 'תפוחים' a &gt; 0.99 probability of being Hebrew, but struggles when given one word from different languages from the Latin alphabet. For example 'intro' is given a &gt; 0.99 probability of being Italian and 'já' a &gt; 0.99 probability of being Hungarian. I was thinking of somehow pooling the words together (as each language has multiple words) and 'sweaty intro' produces a &gt; 0.99 probability of being English while 'ele já' produces a &gt; 0.99 probability of being Portuguese.</p>
<pre><code>testWords = ['这是什么', '这是什么', '王明是学生。', 'sweaty', 'intro', 'am', 'תפוח' ,'תפוחים', 'אני', 'criança', 'ele', 'já']

<p>Using this solution, I have rows <code>1,5, and 7</code>  classified <code>correct</code>  but other rows are classified wrong. It is because this solution works based on character extraction I believe. For instance, in <code>row 2</code> , there is character <code>é</code>  in <code>Hélsinki</code>  and that's why this text classified as <code>NA</code>  or <code>Non-English</code>  whereas the text is manly written in the <code>English</code>  language. Or, in <code>row 4</code> , the main language of the text is <code>French</code>  but because there is no French character due to punctuation and written issues in the text, it is classified as English text.</p>
<p>I wonder if there is solution for classifying text based on its main language of the text that is more sophisticated than only finding one character in the text. So, in this case my ideal output should be:</p>

Replicating a Google ngram plot in R,"<p>I'm trying to replicate a plot from the paper Michel et al., 'Quantitative Analysis of Culture Using Millions of Digitized Books' (2011). Specifically I'm trying to make the one on the top right here:
<a href=""https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21163965/#&amp;gid=article-figures&amp;pid=fig-3-uid-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21163965/#&amp;gid=article-figures&amp;pid=fig-3-uid-2</a></p>
<p>I know the paper used v1 of the corpus but I'm doing it with v2 as it's easier to work with. When I use the Google Ngram viewer (specifying the English 2012 corpus which corresponds to v2, a year range of 1875 to 1975, and no smoothing) I get <a href=""https://books.google.com/ngrams/graph?content=1883%2C1910%2C1950&amp;year_start=1875&amp;year_end=1975&amp;corpus=15&amp;smoothing=0"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a>, which looks pretty close.</p>
<p>When I tried to replicate this in <code>R</code>/<code>ggplot</code> I get this:
<a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/x5zjw.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/x5zjw.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>1950 and 1883 look pretty consistent with what is happening in the viewer plot, but I can't figure out what is happening with 1910. There appears to be very few occurrences of the year '1910' in the data set in comparison to some of the other years. Would anyone with a better understanding of the Google ngrams data set be able to point me in the right direction? Should I be supplementing this with something other than just the 1-gram dataset? Does the Google ngram viewer pick out occurrences of 1-grams in a different way?</p>
<p>The code I've used is below. A couple of other points: 1910 and 1950 do not seem to exist as 1-grams in the v2 data set, but 1883 does. To get this to even remotely work, I had to <code>grepl</code> for 1950 and 1910 to get any hits (i.e. they all seem to appear as parts of date ranges like 1890-1910, or with some other characters tacked on), rather than just doing a fixed search for those years in the <code>ngram</code> field. I also used <code>purrr::map_dfr</code> to do this rather than just a <code>dplyr::case_when</code> in case years appeared in the same ngram picked up by a <code>grepl</code> (e.g. the range 1883-1910 should be a hit for both of those years, not just one).</p>

<p>This code works pretty well when the batch size is 1. But it is so slow. I wanted to increase the batch size from 1 to 32, but I get some dimension compatibility problems. How can I increase the batch size without errors?</p>

<p>For example, assume that x.shape is (batch_size, 12) (meaning we have 'batch_size' sentences of length 12 as input and y.shape is also (batch_size, 12) (the translations). And also we have a word-to-id dictionary of length 90 that matches each word in a sentence with its index)</p>

Correct way of loading torchtext model + vocab for inference,"<p>I trained a Transformer model for translation. The saved model achieves ~27 BLEU on my test set. When I reload the model in a new session the BLEU score dips to ~0.5.

How can I conjugate English words to the progressive form in Python?,"<p>I have looked at <code>pattern.en</code>'s <code>conjugate</code>, but it only conjugates into a few forms, and I would rather not have to sit down and program all of the exceptions to those rules that would allow me to make conjugations such as</p>

<li>eat - eating</li>
<li>bathe - bathing </li>
<li>be - being</li>

Calculate frequency of word pattern in documents,"<p>I am trying to calculate frequency of word pattern in documents.
e.g. How many times word pattern &quot;Natural Language Processing&quot; is appearing in the documents.
I tried it using TF-IDF and Bag of words. however, it is giving me frequency of each word separately.</p>
<p>Is there any way to solve this problem using NLP, Text mining?</p>
<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>I work on syntactic dependencies. Here you can see that nodes item are tokens (with parts of speech tag etc... My task is to target item with a[8]='sub'. After that, i need to extract the words in relation between. It's a[9]. It's the index of the beginning of the syntactic dependence. In the first sentence (description node), the sub item is</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;&lt;a&gt;23&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;eu&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;avoir&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;VPP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;VPP&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;n=s|g=m|t=K&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;sub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;sub&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>I need to extract his a[9] (here is 19). In fact, it's the index of the first word of my syntactic dependecie. This is this item (basing on index a[1])</p>
<pre><code>&lt;item&gt;&lt;a&gt;19&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;quand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;quand&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;CS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;CS&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;4&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a&gt;mod&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/item&gt;
</code></pre>
<p>What i have to do ? get all items (in fact a[2] value between the index of this word and my item
with 'sub'. In the first sentence, the following output would be</p>
<pre><code>quand le moteur a eu
</code></pre>
<p>it's an extraction of nodes between two nodes with index. But here is my following code. I can't grab the items nodes between each other item. Be careful, it may have more than one sub item by sentence so i needed to add a for loop</p>
<pre><code>for $p in /basetalismane/file/*//p
let $items := /$p//item[a[8]='sub']
for $p in /basetalismane/file/*//p
let $items := /$p//item[a[8]='sub']
for $item in $items
let $target := /$item/a[9]
let $source := /$item/a[1]
return (
for $i in ($target to $source)
return string-join( $p/item[$i]/a[2]  , ' '))
</code></pre>
<p>I get only each word but not the sequence. I can't concatenate strings one word by one.
i've done a return $nodes to see what i grab. It's only sub items. I want the item between. I would like a list of item or a string with their a[2] to have the words. In the second sentence, the following output would be</p>
<pre><code>que la reconquete autoproclamée de la &quot;capitale&quot; de l'EI était
</code></pre>

Spell Check/DidYouMean for Japanese language,"<p>looking for ideas for implementing Spellcheck/DidYouMean for the Japanese language (mostly).
The target for spellcheck is search queries, search engine build on solr, but the solution is not bound to it.</p>
<p>So far found two main approached:</p>
<ul>
<li>edit distance for dictionary (libraries like SymSpell)</li>
<li>statistic, based on user rewritten queries</li>
</ul>
<p>The first approach seems not very feasible for Kanji/Kana.
Also, its results as-is are quite noisy and it's complicated to build a lot of clean N-grams for contextual spellcheck (so 'hollow world' would be fixed as 'hello world').
Any suggestions on how it could be done?</p>
<p>The second approach is complicated because it's difficult to detect rewritten queries and since users rarely do so or do it correctly - it's hard to gather such statistics.</p>
<p>The main articles/videos that I found so far are quite a high level and too simple (for edit distance they don't provide applicable for real-world approaches to reduce noise to a reasonable level - 95% or higher) or focused on English only.</p>
<p>Any pointers for some published papers are welcome :)
Thanks in advance.</p>

Python prints Arabic text that includes punctuation incorrectly although it seems to be correctly stored,"<p>There is strange behavior on printing Arabic text that includes punctuation in Python.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>word_1 = &quot;...واحد&quot;
word_2 = &quot;اثنان&quot;
word_list = [word_1, word_2]
print(word_list)

<p>The output of the previous code is <code>['...واحد', 'اثنان']</code> but the correct output should be <code>['واحد...', 'اثنان']</code>. This problem seems to exist only when I print the output. However, when I retrieve the first index I see the correct form. So the output of <code>word_list[0]</code> is <code>...واحد</code> which is correct.</p>
<p>The problem is that I want to print something to the user at the end so I want to print the output correctly. Therefore, I want the output to be <code>['واحد...', 'اثنان']</code>.</p>

<p>which takes a long time because the database is nearly 1gb. Suppose the above code is in the file <code>nlp_file.py</code>. If I want to use the function <code>nlp</code> in my module importing using <code>from nlp_file import nlp</code>, I can do one of a few things:</p>
<ol>
<li>Load it when my module is imported in the <code>__init__.py</code> file.</li>
<li>Load it at the beginning of each file that uses it.</li>
<li>Load only when I need to call <code>nlp</code>.</li>
</ol>
<p>I think that 3 is the best option here, but goes against all my python instincts to put import statements at the top of files. If I put it in  <code>__init__.py</code> then everytime I want to use part of my module that doesn't require nlp I will take a massive performance hit. If I load it at the beginning of each file that uses it, I will have the same problem. Therefore it makes most sense to import at the beginning of functions and classes that require nlp.</p>
<p>Am I correct in believing this? Is there a better way to use <code>nlp</code> in different parts of my module? Thank you in advance!</p>

Natural Language date and time parser for java,"<p>I am working on a Natural Language parser which examines a sentence in english and extracts some information like name, date etc.</p>

<p>for example: ""<em>Lets meet next tuesday at 5 PM at the beach.</em>""</p>

<p>So the output will be something like : ""<em>Lets meet 15/09/2009 at 1700 hr at the beach</em>""</p>

<p>So basically, what i want to know is that <strong>is there any framework or library available for JAVA to do these kind of operations like parsing dates from a sentence and give a output with some specified format.</strong> </p>

Would it be very inefficient to have a repository of words to check a single language against?,"<p>I am doing some NLP with Python on YouTube comments I have downloaded, and I only want to process English ones. So far I have experimented with different libraries (many of the ones discussed in <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39142778/python-how-to-determine-the-language"">this</a> thread) and it works fine for longer strings, but many of the libraries often run into problems with the shorter, one or two worders. My question is whether it would be hopelessly inefficient to download a dictionary of English words and check each of these short, problematic comments against it, obviously discarding the ones that don't match.</p>

NLP detect English conditional statements,"<p>I'm currently working on a project in which I need to manipulate English conditional statements. I downloaded the NLTK library and it seems a very good NLP module. The question is: Is there a built-in mechanism in NLTK (or other libraries) to identify conditional statements? or maybe a paper explaining how to detect conditional statements?</p>

<p>I've read that there are different types of conditional statements, most of them rely on the word IF. But also there are other situations in which a condition can be present without IF (like using unless for example).</p>

<p>Can anyone guide me?</p>

Is there a limit to the size of target word vocabulary that should be used in seq2seq models?,"<p>In a machine translation seq2seq model (using RNN/GRU/LSTM) we provide sentence in a source language and train the model to map it to a sequence of words in another language (e.g., <em>English to German</em>).</p>
<p>The idea is, that the decoder part generates a classification vector (which has the size of target word vocabulary) and a softmax is applied on this vector followed by an argmax to get the index of the most probable word.</p>
<p><strong>My question is</strong>: is there an upper limit to how large the target word vocabulary should be, considering:</p>
<ol>
<li>The performance remains reasonable (<em>softmax will take more time for larger vectors</em>)</li>
<li>The accuracy/correctness of prediction is acceptable</li>

Natural categorization of common nouns,"<p>In the software I'm developing, I have to <strong>divide arbitrary nouns</strong> of common things (belonging to a single natural language) <strong>into some predefined natural categories</strong>, obtaining a tree structure.</p>
<p>Example: &quot;<em>wine</em>&quot; must fall under &quot;<em>drink</em>&quot;, &quot;<em>drink</em>&quot; under &quot;<em>food</em>&quot;.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any archives</strong> that can be used for this type of categorization, or component/services that perform it automatically (even for a fee)? If for Javascript or Java or C++, all the better, but the important for me is the archive, not the software.
Or could you tell me if there is a precise label with which to call it, so that I can search for material in google?</p>
<p>Any suggestions, or references to useful focused reading, will be greatly appreciated.</p>
<h2>Details:</h2>
<p>In the non-digital world, the categorization I need is operated in dictionaries called -at least in Italy- &quot;<strong>Analog Dictionaries</strong>&quot; (but in the English language, it doesn't seem to be a fixed term to define these dictionaries), but I need a <em>digital</em> archive/tool, to use in my program.</p>
<p>My research has made me find tools related to Machine Learning or Natural Language Processing (that I don't know), but none seem to meet my need (despite they being able to perform much more complex categorizations). For example, Google's &quot;<strong>Cloud Natural Language</strong>&quot; API offers the &quot;Classifying Content&quot; tool: passing a text to the <code>classifyText()</code> method, a category is returned. However, the possible categories form an unstructured and very limited list, and there is also a constraint on the input that must be at least 20 words.
Some tools (related to &quot;tagging&quot;) instead seem able to do what I need, but first providing them with a database, which is the main thing I miss.</p>
<p>Since in my case the set of input words is probably limited to commonly used terms, I also thought of writing such an archive myself, perhaps using the various monothematic lists I found on the web; however it would not be a short job and probably already done by others.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the future I may need to support in input not only nouns but noun phrases (I refer to the Generative Grammar terminlogy: article + adjective + noun), and therefore having to remove the article and any adjectives before categorizing the substantive: it would therefore be useful if the syntactic category of each word was also available in the archive (even if, for my needs, the syntactic order would often be enough for the parsing: for example &quot;a good man&quot; -&gt; &quot;man&quot;).</p>

Python library to scrape formatted text from arbitrary webpage,"<p>I'm doing a project in Python which involves:</p>

<ol>
<li>Extracting source code from webpage in url given as input (using Selenium with Chrome WebDriver)</li>
<li>Parse the source code and extract the visible text (using BeautifulSoup)</li>
<li>Do Natural Language Processing (NLP) on the extracted text</li>
</ol>

<p>Although, for the NLP to be successful, the text needs to be extracted as it is visually presented in the browser - which doesn't always coincide with the formatting on the source code, i.e. sometimes the text from a paragraph is broken down into several different elements -> which breaks the scraping all together and makes it non-viable for NLP.</p>

<p>I know it's a really challenging task to develop such ""visual based"" scraper, as opposed to a ""element based"" one, but is there something already developed on that direction?</p>

Determining Grammatical Validity of Text Input,"<p>I am looking for some way to determine if textual input takes the form of a valid sentence; I would like to provide a warning to the user if not. Examples of input I would like to warn the user about:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;dog hat can ah!&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;slkj ds dsak&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It seems like this is a difficult problem, since grammars are usually derived from textbanks, and the words in the provided sentence input might not appear in the grammar. It also seems like parsers maybe make assumptions that the textual input is comprised of valid English words to begin with. (just my brief takeaway from playing around with Stanford NLP's GUI tool). My questions are as follows:</p>
<ol>
<li>Is there some tool available to scan through text input and determine if it is made up of valid English words, or at least offer a probability on that? If not, I can write this, just wondering if it already exists. I figure this would be step 1 before determining grammatical correctness.</li>
<li>My understanding is that determining whether a sentence is grammatically correct is done simply by attempting to parse the sentence and see if it is possible. Is that accurate? Are there probabilistic parsers that offer a degree of confidence when ambiguity is encountered? (e.g., a proper noun not recognized)</li>
<li>I hesitate to ask this last question, since I saw it was <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/q/6115677/290136"">asked on SO over a decade ago</a>, but any updates as to whether there is a basic, readily available grammar for NLTK? I know English isn't simple, but I am truly just looking to parse relatively simple, single sentence input.</li>

Natural Language Processing LSTM Neural Network Accuracy too Low,"<p>I have been learning Neural networks for a while now, predominantly with respect to natural language processing.

<p>When you sign up for the free corpus, you are directed to a dropbox folder. The corpus is 1 TB and (as of this writing) has four parts. I only wanted to download PART 1 but even this has 1446 zip files that are each quite larger. My question is: how do I programmatically download many large files from dropbox onto a Linux (Ubunut 16.04) VM using only the command line.</p>

<p>I assumed this was because the <code>WAVE</code> directory was too large for Dropbox to zip.</p>
<ol start=""2"">

</li>
<li><p>Based on the same post as in (2), I could also try to create shared links for each zip file using the dropbox API, though this seemed too cumbersome.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Download the Linux dropbox client and sync the relevant files as outlined in <a href=""https://www.dropbox.com/install-linux"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this installation</a>.</p>

Algorithm to Detect and Compare Phrases,"<p>I have a couple of non-English texts. I would like to perform stylistic comparisons on them.</p>

How to normalize Persian texts with Hazm,"<p>I have a folder containing some other <em>folders</em> and each contains a lot of text files. I have to extract <strong>5 words</strong> before and after a specific word and following code works fine.</p>

<p>The problem is that because I did not normalize the texts, it just returns a few sentences while there is more. 
In Persian there is a module called <strong>hazm</strong> for normalizing the texts. How can I use that in this code? </p>

<p>For example of normalizing: <strong>""ك""</strong>  should change to <strong>""ک""</strong> or <strong>""ؤ""</strong> should change to ""و"". Because the first two ones are actually <em>Arabic</em> alphabets which were used in <em>Persian</em>. Without normalizing the code just returns the words that are written with the second form and it does not recognize the words which are in the first forms <em>Arabic</em>).</p>

<pre><code>import os
from hazm import Normalizer


def getRollingWindow(seq, w):
    win = [next(seq) for _ in range(11)]
    yield win
    for e in seq:
        win[:-1] = win[1:]
        win[-1] = e

What do the logits and probabilities from RobertaForSequenceClassification represent?,"<p>Being new to the &quot;Natural Language Processing&quot; scene, I am experimentally learning and have implemented the following segment of code:</p>

quanteda - stopwords not working in French,"<p>For some reason, stop words is not working for my corpus, entirely in French. I've been trying repeatedly over the past few days, but many words that should have been filtered simply are not. I am not sure if anyone else has a similar issue?

How to use language independent canonical form in list entities in LUIS?,"<p>When using a closed list entity in LUIS, there always is a canonical form and optional multiple synonyms.</p>
<p>In the example below there is the canonical form &quot;green&quot; and one possible synonym &quot;olive&quot;.</p>

<p>But since language may change and the frontend software should be language independent, what I actually want to be delivered from the API is not the english term &quot;green&quot;, but a language independent identifier string for green, like &quot;my_chatbot_green_id&quot;.</p>
<p>Is it recommendable, to use the identifier as canocical form, and add &quot;green&quot; as a synonym instead? I suppose it isn't. Is there then any other way to achieve language independent identifiers?</p>

packaging public data with R,"<p>I'm a college student who is interested in participating a hackathon for packaging public data with R.</p>

<p>How can I remove a keyword (except for the name of the person) from this sentence, such as &quot;American&quot;, &quot;footballer&quot;, &quot;Barcelona&quot; to name a few.</p>

output (e.g. in Spanish):</p>

<p>ROUGE-n F1-score=40% is
more difficult to interpret, like any F1-score.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is contradictory. Its sounds like <strong>Rouge-Precision</strong> is <strong>equal</strong> to <strong>BLEU</strong> and <strong>Rouge-Recall</strong> is <strong>equal</strong> to the statement made in the <strong>SO answer</strong>. Is Rouge-Precision the same as BLEU as it implemented BLEU?</p>
<p>It is also stated in the <a href=""https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W04-1013.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">paper</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>It is clear that ROUGE-N is a recall-related measure because the
denominator of the equation is the total sum of the number of n-grams
occurring at the reference summary side. A closely related measure,
BLEU, used in automatic evaluation of machine translation, is a
precision-based measure.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I dont understand this, as (atleast) <strong>rouge</strong> returns a <strong>precision</strong> and a <strong>recall</strong> value. Can anybody bring some clearness into this?
Thank you!</p>

Graph to connect sentences,"<p>I have a list of sentences of a few topics (two) like the below:</p>
<pre><code>Sentences
Trump says that it is useful to win the next presidential election. 
The Prime Minister suggests the name of the winner of the next presidential election.
In yesterday's conference, the Prime Minister said that it is very important to win the next presidential election. 
The Chinese Minister is in London to discuss about climate change.
The president Donald Trump states that he wants to win the presidential election. This will require a strong media engagement.
The president Donald Trump states that he wants to win the presidential election. The UK has proposed collaboration. 
The president Donald Trump states that he wants to win the presidential election. He has the support of his electors. 
</code></pre>
<p>As you can see there is similarity in sentences.</p>
<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/TVJ8f.png"" rel=""noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/TVJ8f.png"" alt=""enter image description here"" /></a></p>
<p>I am trying to relate multiple sentences and visualise the characteristics of them by using a graph (directed). The graph is built from a similarity matrix, by applying row ordering of sentences as shown above.
I created a new column, Time, to show the order of sentences, so first row (Trump says that....) is at time 1; second row (The Prime Minister suggests...) is at time 2, and so on.
Something like this</p>
<pre><code>Time    Sentences
1           Trump said that it is useful to win the next presidential election. 
2           The Prime Minister suggests the name of the winner of the next presidential election.

3           In today's conference, the Prime Minister said that it is very important to win the next presidential election. 

...
</code></pre>
<p>I would like then to find the relationships in order to have a clear overview of the topic.
Multiple paths for a sentence would show that there are multiple information associated with it.
To determine similarity between two sentences, I tried to extract nouns and verbs as follows:</p>
<pre><code>noun=[]
verb=[]
for  index, row in df.iterrows():
      nouns.append([word for word,pos in pos_tag(row[0]) if pos == 'NN'])
      verb.append([word for word,pos in pos_tag(row[0]) if pos == 'VB'])
</code></pre>
<p>as they are keywords in whatever sentence.
So when a keyword (noun or verb) appears in sentence x but not in the other sentences, it represents a difference between these two sentences.
I think a better approach, however, could be using word2vec or gensim (WMD).</p>
<p>This similarity has to be calculated for each sentence.
I would like to build a graph which shows the content of the sentence in my example above.
Since there are two topics (Trump and Chinese Minister), for each of them I need to look for sub-topics. Trump has sub-topic presidential election, for example. A node in my graph should represent a sentence. Words in each node represent differences for the sentences, showing new info in the sentence. For example, the word <code>states</code> in sentence at time 5 is in adjacent sentences at time 6 and 7.
I would like just to find a way to have similar results as shown in picture below. I have tried using mainly nouns and verbs extraction, but probably it is not the right way to proceed.
What I tried to do has been to consider sentence at time 1 and compare it with other sentences, assigning a similarity score (with noun and verbs extraction but also with word2vec), and repeat it for all the other sentences.
But my problem is now on how to extract difference to create a graph that can make sense.</p>
<p>For the part of the graph, I would consider to use networkx (DiGraph):</p>
<pre><code>G = nx.DiGraph()
N = Network(directed=True) 
</code></pre>
<p>to show direction of relationships.</p>
<p>I provided a different example to make it be clearer (but if you worked with the previous example, it would be fine as well. Apologies for the inconvenience, but since my first question was not so clear, I had to provide also a better, probably easier, example).</p>

Dutch sentiment analysis using R,"<p>In RStudio, I have column containing <strong>Dutch</strong> sentences which I would like to add a polarity score between -1.0 and +1.0 to via sentiment analysis. I've already tried to use the <code>pattern.nlp</code> package from jwfijffels, but this didn't work for me. I found an instruction on <a href=""https://github.com/bnosac/pattern.nlp"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/bnosac/pattern.nlp</a> in which it is explained that - in order for the nlp package to work, you should download a specific version of Python and perform some additional steps. However, these steps are a bit vague to me.</p>
<p>Is there someone who can explain this installation process to me in more detail? Actually, the whole section under &quot;Installation&quot; is a bit of a mystery to me. What should I download specifically?
Where to run the code <code>pip install pattern</code>? How do I properly set the PATH? It would be much appreciated if someone would guide me trough it step by step.</p>
<p>Or: if someone knows another way to perform sentiment analysis on text, I would of course be open to it, e.g. translating the Dutch sentences to English and then perform the sentiment analysis. Or would such a translation be a bad idea?</p>
<p>Here a set of 6 Dutch sentences.</p>
<pre><code>text = c(&quot;Slechte bediening, van begin tot eind&quot;,
         &quot;Het eten was heerlijk en de bediening was fantastisch&quot;,
         &quot;Geweldige service en beleefde bediening&quot;,
         &quot;Verschrikkelijk. Ik had een vlieg in mijn soep&quot;, 
         &quot;Het was oké. De bediening kon wat beter, maar het eten was wel lekker. Leuk sfeertje wel!&quot;,
         &quot;Ondanks dat het druk was toch op tijd ons eten gekregen. Complimenten aan de kok voor het op smaak brengen van mijn biefstuk&quot;)

Where did I go wrong with retrieving POS proportions through analysis with spaCy?,"<p>So, recently, I've been quite intent on getting some statistics regarding the vocabulary of some of the books I like. Nothing advanced---just things like, what is the average length of a sentence? How many adjectives are used in proportion to the total number of words?</p>
<p>The problem is---spaCy, which is the tool I chose for sheer simplicity of use, seems to indicate that: EVERY TEXT I analyze seems to have EXACTLY 5.88235% of adjectives compared to total number of words. EXACTLY 2.94118% of auxiliaries. EXACTLY 14.7059% of nouns. EXACTLY 34 words per sentence (!).</p>
<p>Now, I am pretty sure that I have made some mistake in the code I am using---it's just, I can't see it!</p>
<p>Here is a sample code. I've divided the book by chapter (34 total) and printed a table of some statistics. The numbers seem legit---but these proportions, there is NO WAY every chapter in every text I am analyzing has exactly the same structure.</p>

wordcloud for non-english corpus,"<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/YdUCc.png"" rel=""noreferrer"">wordcloud for non English text</a></p>

<p>Dear friends
I am facing problems in generating proper wordcloud for non english text. The cloud is generated but it gives un-satisfactroy results. It shows wordcloud with characters only while I require wordcloud with proper words.
I processed following code to generate wordcloud.</p>

<pre><code>from os import path
from scipy.misc import imread
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import random
import unicodedata
from wordcloud import WordCloud, STOPWORDS
text = scorpus
wordcloud = WordCloud(font_path='MBKhursheed.ttf',
                      relative_scaling = 1.0,
                      stopwords = sw
                      ).generate(text)
plt.imshow(wordcloud)
plt.axis(""off"")
plt.show()

How to automatically detect code snippet from a text sample?,"<p>I'm doing some analysis on GitHub comments. But for that, I need to exclude the code samples and error messages from the comments automatically from a large set.</p>

<p>The other easier way to say this would be, I can keep only the English part of the comments. Although there are few libraries to detect the language of a sentence, there are few challenges in my case too.  1) the comment part does not always follow proper English grammar, 2) the code sample and error message mainly consist of English words too.</p>

<p>So what should be my best approach. The results don't need to be 100% accurate, I just want to know the best approach that can give me a satisfactory result at least. Any idea?</p>

Encoding two different languages using pd.read_csv problem,"<p>I am building a Neural Machine Automatic Translator from German to Arabic.

<p>So, can anyone please help me to solve this problem or how to work around it?

NLP: retrieve vocabulary from text,"<p>I have some texts in different languages and, potentially, with some typo or other mistake, and I want to retrieve their own vocabulary. I'm not experienced with NLP in general, so maybe I use some word improperly.</p>

<p>With <strong>vocabulary</strong> I mean a collection of words of a single language in which every word is unique and the inflections for gender, number, or tense are not considered (e.g. <em>think</em>, <em>thinks</em> and <em>thought</em> are are all consider <em>think</em>).</p>

<p>This is the master problem, so let's reduce it to the vocabulary retrieving of one language, English for example, and without mistakes.</p>

<p>I think there are (at least) three different approaches and maybe the solution consists of a combination of them:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>search in a database</strong> of words stored in relation with each others. So, I could search for <em>thought</em> (considering the verb) and read the associated information that <em>thought</em> is an inflection of <em>think</em></li>
<li><strong>compute the ""base form""</strong> (a word without inflections) of a word by processing the inflected form. Maybe it can be done with stemming?</li>
<li><strong>use a service by any API</strong>. Yes, I accept also this approach, but I'd prefer to do it locally</li>
</ul>

<p>For a first approximation, it's not necessary that the algorithm distinguishes between nouns and verbs. For instance, if in the text there were the word <em>thought</em> like both noun and verb, it could be considered already present in the vocabulary at the second match.</p>

<p>We have reduced the problem to retrieve a vocabulary of an English text without mistakes, and without consider the tag of the words.</p>

<p>Any ideas about how to do that? Or just some tips?</p>

<p>Of course, if you have suggestions about this problem also with the others constraints (mistakes and multi-language, not only Indo-European languages), they would be much appreciated.</p>

"algorithm to detect time, date and place from invitation text","<p>I am researching some Natural Language Processing algorithms to read a piece of text, and if the text seems to be trying to suggest a meeting request, it sets up that meeting for you automatically.</p>

<p>Are there any NLP tools that will perform this address-identification within a block of text? Any suggestions for another way to go about it? Because Google's geocoder handles such a wide array of address formats (even a point of interest like 'The eaton centre, Toronto' counts as an address), I can't use regex to pluck the address out.</p>

Calculate the percentage of accuracy with which user made the assigned sound,"<p>I want to design a web-app for my cousin who is 2 years of age in which i have implemented a functionality in which when an image is clicked some sound gets played and the user has to make the same sound which gets recorded.<br><br>

Splitting Text information in a dataframe into single words and detect if they are part of a dictionary R,"<p>I am trying write a script to detect if one word of an undefined amount of words is part of a dictionary.</p>

Working Azure HTTP function app breaks upon publishing,"<p>I am developing a natural language processing function with visual studio code and Microsoft Azure. The function triggers on an http request, and works perfectly on my local host during testing. However, as soon as I publish the function to Azure, the function becomes unresponsive, citing a &quot;500 internal error.&quot; I believe the problem might have something to do with a specific dependency not being installed upon publishing.</p>

How can I use NLP to group multiple senteces by semantic similarity,"<p>I'm trying to increase the efficiency of a non-conformity management program. Basically, I have a database containing about a few hundred rows, each row describes a non-conformity using a text field.
Text is provided in Italian and I have no control over what the user writes.
I'm trying to write a python program using NTLK to detect how many of these rows report the same problem, written differently but with similar content.
For example, the following sentences need to be related, with a high rate of confidence</p>

<ul>
<li>I received 10 pieces less than what was ordered</li>
<li>10 pieces have not been shipped</li>
</ul>

<p>I also found other questions on SO but they all refer to word similarity, two sentences comparison, or comparison using a reference meaning.</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/24407333/how-to-perform-semantic-similarity-in-document"">This one uses a reference meaning</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/44234909/wordnet-based-semantic-similarity-measurements"">This one refers to two sentences comparison</a></li>
</ul>

<p>In my case, I have no reference and I have multiple sentences that needs to be grouped if they refer to similar problems, so I wonder if this job it's even possible to do with a script.</p>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/2057825/10511191"">This answer</a> says that it cannot be done but it's quite old and maybe someone knows something new.</p>

Good Examples: English Parsing / Natural Language Processing,"<p>I would like to make a calendar application that accepts plain english input better than those that exist.

How to find the characteristics of a bunch of word Clusters?,"<p><strong>My Motivations</strong>  I'm trying to learn German and realized there's a confounding fact with the structure of German: every noun has a gender which seems unrelated to the noun itself in many cases.</p>

<p>Unlike languages such as English, each noun has a different definite article, depending on gender: <em>der</em> (masculine), <em>die</em> (feminine), and <em>das</em> (neuter). For example:
<em>das Mädchen</em> (""the girl""), <em>der Rock</em> (""the skirt), <em>die Hose</em> (""the trousers/pants""). So, there seems to be no correlation between gender assignment of nouns and their meanings.</p>

<p><strong>The Data</strong>
I gathered up to 5000 German words with <strong>3 columns (das, der, die)</strong> for each word with 1's and 0's. So, my data is already clustered with one hot encoding and I'm not trying to predict anything. </p>

<p><strong>Why I'm here</strong> I am clueless on where to start, how to approach this problem as the concept of distance in clustering doesn't make sense to me in this setting. I can't think of a way to generate an understandable description of these clusters. The mixed data makes it impossible for me to think of some hard-coded metrics for evaluation.</p>

<p><strong>So, my question is:</strong>
I want to find some patterns, some characteristics of these words that made them fall in a specific cluster. I don't know if I'm making any sense but some people managed to find some patterns already (for example word endings, elongated long objects tend to be masculine etc., etc) and I believe ML/AI could do a way better job at this. Would it be possible for me to do something like this?</p>

<p><strong>Some personal thoughts</strong>
While I was doing some research (perhaps, naive), I realized the potential options are <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Decision_tree"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">decision trees</a> and <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobweb_(clustering)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">cobweb algorithms</a>. Also, I was thinking if I could just scrape a few images (say 5) for every word and try to run some image classification and see the intermediate NN's to see if any specific shapes support a specific object gender. In addition to that, I was wondering whether scraping the data of google n-gram viewers of these words could help in anyway. I couldn't think of a way to use NLP or its sub domains.</p>

<p><strong>Alternatives</strong> If everything I just wrote sounds nonsensical, please suggest me a way to make visual representations of my dataframe (more like nodes and paths with images at nodes, one for each cluster) in Python so that I could make pictorial mind maps and try to by heart them.</p>

<p><strong>The ultimate purpose is to make learning German simpler</strong> for myself and possibly for others</p>

Bottleneck Feature extraction for phonemes in language translation model using machine learning,"<p>I have built a basic encoder decoder model architecture for language translation directly from audio speeches but it desperately needs some increase in performance/accuracy. The only thing I have not been able to achieve is extracting the bottleneck features from the input audio files and taking it forward to the decoder via the attention mechanism.</p>

<p>I'm very new to this. I came across the Bottleneck Feature Extractor (<a href=""https://github.com/iondel/multilingual-bottleneck-features"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/iondel/multilingual-bottleneck-features</a>) and Kaldi's ASR toolkit ( <a href=""https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi</a> ). The first one uses .scp files made in Kaldi style from what I could understand. I was wondering if someone could tell me in as simple language as possible, as to how do I use these amazing toolkits (Or any other out there, or any other tips) to extract phoneme features from my input audio spectrogram and send it forward in the pipeline to the decoder?</p>

When I try to save the result in the database I get the error
bson.errors.invalidDocument: the document must be a valid utf-8</p>

when I'm processing the webpages I try remove the punctuation, but I can't remove accents because I'll get a wrong word.</p>

<p><strong>What I already tried</strong>
I've tried identify the char encode through the header from the webpage
I've tried utilize the chardet</p>

<p>utilize the re.compile(r""[^a-zA-Z]"") and/or unicode(variable,'ascii', 'ignore');<br>
that isn't good for non-English languages because they remove the accents. </p>

Chomsky hierarchy - examples with real languages,"<p>I'm trying to understand the four levels of the Chomsky hierarchy by using some real languages as models.

Since Chomsky is from US, I guess that the American language is an example of Context-free grammar. My questions are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Are there languages which can be generated by regular grammars (type 3)?</li>
<li>Since the Recursively enumerable grammars can generate all languages, why not using that? Are they too complicated and less linear?</li>

How to search a text for compound phrases that may be separated in the text; in python?,"<p>Assume I have a text and want to check if it contains some compound phrase, where I also want to include the cases where the respective words may not be directly followed by each other.</p>

<p>I have no expertise in NLP, so maybe there is some clever way to do this, and I just do not know the correct term to search for. 
Of course, if the text is not too large, one could do the following exhaustive search on all 2-word-combinations:</p>

<pre><code>import itertools
import spacy

nlp = spacy.load({model})
doc = nlp(text)
wordlist =[t.lemma_ for t in doc if (not t.is_punct and not t.is_stop and not t.is_digit)]

Keras LSTM go_backwards usage,"<p>I have a question regarding the usage of the go_backwards argument in the Keras LSTM model layer.  The documentation for this layer can be found here:  <a href=""https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://keras.io/layers/recurrent/#lstm</a>.  </p>

<p>Question1:  If I set the ""go_backwards"" flag to True, do I still feed the input data ""forwards"" during the training process.  For example, if an input sentence in English normally reads ""I fell"", and it's German translation reads ""Ich fiel"", would I feed it forwards (""I fell"", ""Ich fiel""), or backwards (""fell I"", ""fiel Ich"") during the training process.</p>

<p>Question 2: Same question for making model predictions, is the data fed forward (""I fell""), or reverse (""fell I"")?</p>

<p>Question 3: If I was trying to use the model below and wanted to reverse the corpus data, would I set the go_backwards flag to true in both LSTM layers or just one?</p>

Natural Language commands,"<p>I would like to enrich my product with a sort of a ""Power Search"" bar. The idea comes from the Word feature ""Tell me what you want to do"", where Word suggests both actions, searching and help. I assume the actions come from some sort of natural language parsing. But I am not sure exactly what the term to look for is. My product is an online product hosted on AWS, so I would prefer to use a product from AWS if possible and not have to write this myself.</p>

<p>One example of what I would like to do is to map a command like <code>BookResource(string resource, date when)</code> to what is written by the user, who might type something like ""Book room in two weeks"" or maybe just ""two weeks"" or ""next week"". Another use case is also recognizing that the user typed a name and then booking on behalf of that user. The user does not exist in our system, so it is just a case of recognizing that it is a name and not something else.</p>

<p>But my problem is that I don't know what this technology is called. I have tried searching for natural language processing but haven't been able to find what I am looking for. </p>

<p>Can anyone tell me what this is called and also if there one or more services I can use from AWS that offers some of that functionality?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance.</p>

Vectorize document based on vocabulary AND regex,"<p>I am trying to train a text classifier using sklearn's CountVectorizer. The problem is that my training documents have many tokens that are document-specific. So for example there are regular english words that the CountVectorizer.fit_transform method works perfectly well on, but then there are some tokens that are formatted that would fit the regex: '\w\d\d\w\w\d', such as 'd84ke2'. As it is now, the fit_transform method would just take 'd84ke2' at face value and use that as a feature. </p>

<p>I want to be able to use those specific tokens that match that specific regex as their own feature, and leave the regular english words as their own features, since creating a feature such as 'd84ke2' would be useless as this will not come up again in any other document. </p>

<p>I've yet to find a way to do this, much less the ""best"" way. Below is an example of code I have, where you can see that the tokens 'j64ke2', 'r32kl4', 'w35kf9', and 'e93mf9' are all turned into their own features. I repeat for clarity: I want to basically condense these features into one and keep the others. </p>

<pre><code>docs = ['the quick brown j64ke2 jumped over the lazy dogs r32kl4.', 
        'an apple a day keeps the w35kf9 away', 
        'you got the lions share of the e93mf9']

How to remove these footnotes from text,"<p>Alright so I have minimal experience with RStudio, I've been googling this for hours now and I'm fed up-- I don't care about the pride of figuring it out on my own anymore, I just want it done. I want to do some stuff with Canterbury Tales-- <a href=""https://www.gutenberg.org/files/22120/22120-h/22120-h.htm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the Middle English version on Gutenberg.</a> </p>

<p>Downloaded the plaintext, trimmed out the meta data, etc but it's chock-full of ""helpful"" footnotes and I can't figure out how to cut them out.  EX:</p>

<p>""And shortly, whan the sonne was to reste, </p>

<p>So hadde I spoken with hem everichon,</p>

<p>That I was of hir felawshipe anon, </p>

<p>And made forward erly for to ryse,</p>

<p>To take our wey, ther as I yow devyse.</p>

<pre><code>19. Hn. Bifel; E. Bifil.   23. E. were; _rest_ was.   24. E. Hn.
compaignye.   26, 32. E. felaweshipe.   Hl. pilgryms; E. pilgrimes.
34. E. oure

But natheles, whyl I have tyme and space,...""
</code></pre>

<p>I at least have the vague notion that this is a grep/regex puzzle. Looking at the text in TextEdit, each bundle of footnotes is indented by 4 spaces, and the next verse starts with a capitalized word indented by (edit: 4 spaces as well). </p>

<p>So I tried downloading the package qdap and using the rm_between function to specify removal of text between four spaces and a number; and two spaces and a capital letter (""    [0-9]"",""  ""[A-Z]"") to no avail. </p>

<p>I mean, this isn't nearly as simple as ""make the text lowercase and remove all the numbers dur-hur"" which all the tutorials are so helpfully offering. But I'm assuming this is a rather common thing that people have to do when dealing with big texts. Can anyone help me? Or do I have to go into textedit and just manually delete all the footnotes?</p>

<p>EDIT: I restarted the workspace today and all I have is a scan of the file, each line stored in a character vector, with the Gutenburg metadata trimmed out:</p>

<pre><code>text&lt;- scan(""thefilepath.txt, what = ""character"", sep = ""\n"")  
start &lt;-which(text==""GROUP A. THE PROLOGUE."")  
end &lt;-which(text==""""God bringe us to the Ioye . that ever schal be!"")  
cant.lines.v &lt;- text[start:end]

</code></pre>

<p>And that's it so far. Eventually I will</p>

<pre><code>cant.v&lt;- paste(cant.lines.v, collapse="" "")
</code></pre>

<p>And then <strong>strsplit</strong> and <strong>unlist</strong> into a vector of individual words-- but I'm assuming, to get rid of the footnotes, I need to <strong>gsub</strong> and replace with blank space, and that will be easier with each separate line? I just don't know how to encode the pattern I need to cut. I believe it is 4 spaces followed by a number, then continuing on until you get to 4 spaces followed by a capitalized word and a second word w/o numbers and special characters and punctuation. </p>

<p>I hope that I'm providing enough information, I'm not well-versed in this but I am looking to become so...thanks in advance.</p>

Word classification algorithm pro cons,"<p>As for college project I am required to build a software that, given some comments concerning a virtual construction site, detects its actual state (<code>just started</code>, <code>in construction</code>, <code>terminated</code>).</p>

<p>For example, given the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>""Happy to hear we can walk through the English Channel bridge""</li>
<li>""Yesterday I went to the newly built bridge to have a trip to France with my friends""</li>
<li>""They just finished the site and there are already cracks in the 5th miles. What a letdown!""</li>
</ul>

<p>The system should detect that the ""English Channel bridge"" construction site has ended.</p>

I've read about <code>SVC</code> but, since I'm not really an expert in this field, I am unsure about the compliance/goodness of SVC with my scenario.</p>

NLP - linguistic consistency analysis,"<p>I hope you can help me :).</p>

<p>I am working for a translation company. </p>

<p>As you know, every translation consists in splitting the original text into small segments and then re-joining them into the final product.</p>

<p>In other words, the segments are considered as ""<strong>translation units</strong>"".</p>

<p>Often, especially for large documents, the translators make some linguistic consistency errors, I try to explain it with an example.</p>

<p>In Spanish, you can use ""tu"" or ""usted"", depending on the context, and this determines the formality-informality tone of the sentence.</p>

<p>So, if you consider these two sentences of a document:</p>

<pre><code>Lara, te has lavado las manos? (TU)

Lara usted se lavò las manos? (USTED)
</code></pre>

<p>They are BOTH correct, but if you consider the whole document, there is a linguistic inconsistency. </p>

<p>I am studying NLP basic in my spare time, and I am figuring out how to create a tool to perform a linguistic consistency analysis on a set of sentences.  </p>

<p>I am looking in particular at <strong>Standford CoreNLP</strong> (I prefer Java to Python). 
I guess that I need some linguistic tools to perform verb analysis first of all. And naturally, the tool would be able to work with different languages (EN, IT, ES, FR, PT).</p>

<p>Anyone can help me to figure out how to start this? </p>

<p>Any help would be appreciated,</p>

<p>thanks in advance!</p>

Fasttext aligned word vectors for translating homographs,"<p><a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Homograph"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Homograph</a> is a word that shares the same written form as another word but has a different meaning, like <strong>right</strong> in the sentences below:</p>

<ul>
<li>success is about making the <strong>right</strong> decisions.</li>
<li>Turn <strong>right</strong> after the traffic light</li>
</ul>

<p>The English word ""right"", in the first case is translated to Swedish as ""rätt"" and to ""höger"" in the second case. The correct translation is possible by looking at the context (surrounding words).</p>

<p><strong>Question 1.</strong> I wonder if fasttext aligned word embedding can come to help for translating these homograph words or words with several possible translations into another language?</p>

<p><strong>[EDIT]</strong> The goal is <strong>not</strong> to query the model for the right translation. The goal is to <strong>pick</strong> the right translation when the following information is given: </p>

<ul>
<li>the two (or several) possible translations options in the target language like ""rätt"" and ""höger""</li>
<li>the surrounding words in the source language </li>

Convert a list of words to a list of integers in scikit-learn,"<p>I want to convert a list of words to a list of integers in scikit-learn, and do so for a corpus that consists of a list of lists of words. E.g. the corpus can be a bunch of sentences. </p>

Feature extraction from a single word,"<p>Usually one wants to get a feature from a text by using the bag of words approach, counting the words and calculate different measures, for example tf-idf values, like this:  <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4207057/how-to-include-words-as-numerical-feature-in-classification"">How to include words as numerical feature in classification</a></p>

How do I match tokens in similar (but not identical strings) so that I can share POS tags from one string to another?,"<p>I have a large corpus of text, split into sentences. I have two versions of each sentence, one version has POS-tagged tokens. I want to POS tag everything in version 1. I want to do this by replacing the words in version 1 with their POS-tagged counterparts from version 2.</p>

<p>There are some complications with this:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Spelling for the same word can be different between the two versions (e.g. <code>'cafe'</code> vs. <code>'café'</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>Spacing in the POS-tagged version doesn't always match spacing in the other (e.g. <code>""did"", ""n't""</code> vs. <code>""didn't""</code>).</p></li>
<li><p>One version uses symbols regularly while the other spells out the full word (e.g. <code>'&amp;'</code> vs. <code>'and'</code>).</p></li>
</ol>

<p>The language of the text isn't English, so the examples above are only a rough approximation of what's going on. Here are a couple of examples from the actual text. I hope it's easy to see how POS-tagged text in version 2 matches the text in version 1 closely, but not exactly; some words are missing, some are spelled differently, some are out of order, etc.</p>

<pre><code>Example 1.
Version 1: "".o. omi adov-ztu jo znóyod sotfico pru &amp; bra""
Version 2: [['omi', '&lt;DET&gt;'], ['adov', '&lt;NOUN&gt;'], ['ztu', '&lt;PRON&gt;'], ['znóyod', '&lt;VERB&gt;'],
           ['sotfico', '&lt;ADJ&gt;'], ['uont', '&lt;CCONJ&gt;'], ['jo', '&lt;ADP&gt;']]

Example 2.
Version 1: ""vomoyj zíy""
Version 2: [['vó', '&lt;SCONJ&gt;'], ['ṁo', '&lt;PART&gt;'], ['yj', '&lt;PRON&gt;'], ['zíy', '&lt;ADJ&gt;']]

Example 3.
Version 1: "".o. fa-tistyjogot""
Version 2: [['fa', '&lt;PP&gt;'], ['t', '&lt;IP&gt;'], ['is', '&lt;UU&gt;'], ['fatistyjogot', '&lt;VERB&gt;']] 
</code></pre>

<p>In example 1 <code>'&amp;'</code> maps to <code>'uont'</code>. The words <code>'pru'</code> and <code>'bra'</code> in version 1 don't map to anything in version 2. The word, <code>'jo'</code>, is also in the wrong place in version 2, and needs to follow the word order of version 1.</p>

<p>In example 2 <code>'vó'</code>, <code>'ṁo'</code>, and <code>'yj'</code> all map to <code>'vomoyj'</code>, even though some characters are different, and it's split in two places.</p>

<p>In example 3 there is only one word, but parts of it are repeated. <code>'fa'</code>, <code>'t'</code>, and <code>'is'</code> all appear in <code>'fatisyjogot'</code>, so i can ignore everything except <code>'fatisyjogot'</code> in version 2.</p>

<p>Where a word is tagged in version 2, I want to replace its counterpart in version 1 with the form from version 2 and the POS-tag. That way I can keep the word order of version 1. If no tagged form exists in version 2, I want to keep the word from version 1 and add the placeholder tag, <code>'&lt;X&gt;'</code>. I also need to leave out any content in version 2 if it is repeated like in example 3. So, from the examples above, I'd like to create the following lists:</p>

<pre><code>Example 1: [['.o.', '&lt;X&gt;'], ['omi', '&lt;DET&gt;'], ['adov', '&lt;NOUN&gt;'], ['ztu', '&lt;PRON&gt;'], ['jo', '&lt;ADP&gt;'],
           ['znóyod', '&lt;VERB&gt;'], ['sotfico', '&lt;ADJ&gt;'], ['pru', '&lt;X&gt;'], ['uont', '&lt;CCONJ&gt;'], ['bra', '&lt;X&gt;']]
Example 2: [['vó', '&lt;SCONJ&gt;'], ['ṁo', '&lt;PART&gt;'], ['yj', '&lt;PRON&gt;'], ['zíy', '&lt;ADJ&gt;']]
Example 3: [['.o.', '&lt;X&gt;'], ['fatistyjogot', '&lt;VERB&gt;']]
</code></pre>

<p>I've tried writing a function using RegEx and the edit distance method from the <code>nltk</code> module to identify similar strings. It works well for longer strings, but because some strings are so short, like <code>'vó'</code> above, it sometimes has difficulties. I've also looked at sequence alignment libraries, but found myself confused trying to apply them.</p>

<p>Is there any way to compare these strings and match every string in version 2 to some substring in version 1 with high accuracy? I can sort out the POS tags myself, I just need a way to find all of the corresponding tokens.</p>

<p>For example, can I write a function, give it the two versions as arguments, and get it to return all the related strings (and their index/placement in the sentence)?</p>

<pre><code>v1 = ""vomoyj zíy""
v2 = [['vó', '&lt;SCONJ&gt;'], ['ṁo', '&lt;PART&gt;'], ['yj', '&lt;PRON&gt;'], ['zíy', '&lt;ADJ&gt;']]

def some_func(v1, v2):
    *do something*
    return comparison_list

print(some_func(v1, v2))

Output:
[['vó', 'vomoyj', 0], ['ṁo', 'vomoyj', 1], ['yj', 'vomoyj', 2], ['zíy', 'zíy', 3]]
*OR*
[['vó', 'vo'], ['ṁo', 'mo'], ['yj', 'yj'], ['zíy', 'zíy']]

"splitting words by syllable with CMU Pronunciation Dictionary, NLTK, and Python3","<p>I am working on a natural language processing project and am stuck on splitting words into syllables (using <code>nltk</code> and <code>cmudict.dict()</code> in <code>python 3</code>).</p>

            if grapheme == word.lower(): # all graphemes are lowercase, we have to word.lower() to match
                syllableCounter = 0
                for x in phonemes[0]:
                    for y in x:

Is there an easy way with built-in functions to automatically retrain a keras NLP model?,"<p>I have a natural language processing model built with keras using  keras.preprocessing.text.Tokenizer. I know that I can retrain the old model by calling it's <code>.fit(...)</code> after importing it, but I need to update my tokenizer as well. The tokenizer does some things: tokenizes a string by spaces, eliminates symbols, converts to lower, keeps only the most used tokens after creating it's dictionary, hash the tokens and appends 0 if the sentence is too short.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<pre class=""lang-py prettyprint-override""><code>tokenizer = Tokenizer(num_words=vocab_size)

tokenizer.fit_on_texts(df_train['message'][0:100].values)

x_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(df_train['message'][0:100].values)

x_train = pad_sequences(x_train, padding='post', maxlen=maxlen)
</code></pre>

<p>This process is needed to be able to input the sequences to a nlp network. The problem appears when I try to automatically retrain this. Every time I retrain, the tokenizer must be updated. If I try to add new text, all the values from the dictionary that the tokenizer class uses(meaning the encoding of a word) changes.</p>

<p>Ex:</p>

<p>If I update like this: <code>tokenizer.fit_on_texts(df_train['message'][100:200].values)</code>,</p>

<p>then the </p>

<p><code>x_train = tokenizer.texts_to_sequences(df_train['message'][0:100].values)</code></p>

In the official documentation it's said that the method ""def fit_on_texts(self, texts)"" ""Updates internal vocabulary based on a list of texts."". It updates, but also changes all the old values of the keys, old or new ones. </p>

"Seq2Seq/ NLP/Translation: After generating the target sentence, does the last decoder hidden state carry any residual meaning?","<p>I am studying machine translation right now and I am interested in a question probing a bit more deeply into the internals of sentence representations.</p>

<p>Suppose we train an encoder-decoder Seq2Seq En-Fr translation system on parallel corpora, starting with pre-trained Eng and Fr word vectors. The system can use anything to form the sentence embedding (Transformers, LSTMs, etc). Then the job of the Seq2Seq translation system is to learn to build Eng sentence representations from Eng word vectors and learn to build French sentence representations from French word vectors and by the linking of the encoder and decoder, learn those two sentence representations in the same space. </p>

<p>After training the model, and encoding some English sentence with the model (Say, ""This is not a pipe.""), the sentence embedding in the joint representation space has some idea of the words 'this', 'is', 'not', 'a', 'pipe', etc and all their associations as well as the sequence in which they appear. (1)</p>

<p>When the decoder is run on the encoding, it is able to take out the aforementioned information due for a load of corpora that was fed to it during training and statistical associations between words, and output, correspondingly, 'Ceci', 'n', ''', 'est', 'pas', 'une', 'pipe', '(EOS)'. At each step, it extracts and outputs the next French word from the decoder hidden state and transforms it so that the heuristically ""most prominent"" word to be decoded next can be found by the decoder, and so on, until '(EOS)'.</p>

<p>My question is this: Is there any interpretation of the last decoder hidden state after (EOS) is the output? Is it useful for anything else? Of course, an easy answer is ""no, the model was trained to capture millions of lines of English text and process them until some word in conjunction with the hidden state produces (EOS) and last decoder hidden state is simply that, everything else not explicitly trained on is just noise and not signal"".</p>

<p>But I'm wondering if there's anything more to this? What I'm trying to get at is, if you have a sentence embedding generated in English, and have the meaning dumped out of it in French by the decoder model, does any residual meaning remain that is not translatable from English to French? Certainly, the last hidden state for any particular sentence's translation would be very hard to interpret, but how about in the aggregate (like some aggregation of the last hidden states of every single sentence to be translated that has the words 'French' in it, which means something slightly different in English because it can be paired with 'fries' etc. This is a silly example, but you can probably think of others exploiting cultural ambiguities, etc, that turn up in language.) Might this last embedding capture some statistical ""uncertainty"" or ambiguity about the translation (maybe of like the English possible ""meanings"" and associations that could have ended up in French but didn't?) or some other structural aspect of the language that might be used to help us understand, say, how English is different from French?</p>

<p>What category do you think the answer to this fall in?</p>

<ul>
<li>""There is no signal"",</li>
<li>""There probably is some signal but it would be
very hard to extract because of depends on the mechanics of how the
model was trained""</li>
<li>""There is a signal that can be reliably extracted,

<p>I'm not sure if this question is sensical at all but I'm curious about the answer and if any research been done on this front? I ask out of plain simple curiosity.</p>

<p><strong>Notes</strong>: <br>
I am aware that the last hidden state exists because it generates (EOS) in conjunction with the last word. That is its purpose, nothing else (?) makes it special. I'm wondering if we can get any more meaning out of it (even if it means transforming it like applying the decoder step one more time to it or something).</p>

<p>The collapse argument created a column with data like:</p>

Processing a Corpus For a word2vec Implementation,"<p>As part of a class project, I'm trying to write a word2vec implementation in Python and train it on a corpus of ~6GB. I'm trying to code a reasonably optimized solution so I don't have to let my PC sit for days.</p>

<p>Going through the C word2vec source code, I notice that there, each thread reads words from a file, and takes the time to look up the index of every word. At the end, it stores a ""sentence"" of word indexes.</p>

<p>Wouldn't it be logical to translate the whole corpus into one containing integer indexes of the appropriate words? That way, time isn't lost during training on hash-table lookups, while the translation process is a one-time expense.</p>

<p>I understand that for extremely large corpuses, you are effectively doubling the amount it takes on disk, which you might want to avoid.</p>

<p>However, if you do have the memory, wouldn't this offer a noticeable increase in efficiency? Or am I just overestimating the impact of a table lookup?</p>

NLP: Permute the order of constituent phrases in an English sentence,"<p>I'm looking for a solution that is not knowledge-base dependent or domain-specific, i.e. for general English text. </p>

<p>For the sentence, ""I went to the store today"", one can identify constituents</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;I went to the store&gt;, &lt;today&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>and permute to ""Today I went to the store."" One could also identify constituents </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>&lt;I went&gt;, &lt;to the store&gt;, &lt;today&gt; </p>
</blockquote>

<p>and permute to ""to the store I went today"", or even ""to the store today I went"". The latter 2 permutations are less idiomatic but still preserve meaning.</p>

<p>My question -- what strategy could I use to identify a set of constituent phrases (e.g. from a parser) to which one could apply arbitrary re-ordering, whilst still preserving basic meaning?</p>

<p>The above examples are relatively simple; my use case is for more general sentences, as found in e.g. transcribed spoken English and email.</p>

<p>I allow that results may be less than grammatical, e.g. ""My friend's private green was ideal for yesterday's game"" might permute to ""for yesterday's game was ideal my friend's private green"", which is not grammatically sound, but the meaning is preserved.</p>

<p>If a strategy can reduce the likelihood of such ungrammatical permutations, that would be a plus, but not a requirement.</p>

Clustering sentence vectors in a dictionary,"<p>I'm working with a kind of unique situation. I have words in Language1 that I've defined in English. I then took each English word, took its word vector from a pretrained GoogleNews w2v model, and average the vectors for every definition. The result, an example with a 3 dimension vector:</p>

<pre><code>L1_words={
'word1': array([ 5.12695312e-02, -2.23388672e-02, -1.72851562e-01], dtype=float32),
'word2': array([ 5.09211312e-02, -2.67828571e-01, -1.49875201e-03], dtype=float32)
}

</code></pre>

<p>What I want to do is cluster (using K-means probably, but I'm open to other ideas) the keys of the dict by their numpy-array values. 
I've done this before with standard w2v models, but the issue I'm having is that this is a dictionary. Is there another data set I can convert this to? I'm inclined to write it to a csv/make it into a pandas datafram and use Pandas or R to work on it like that, but I'm told that floats are problem when it comes to things requiring binary (as in: they lose information in unpredictable ways). I tried saving my dictionary to hdf5, but dictionaries are not supported. </p>

"Create subject-verb-object model of complex, fragmented sentences from police reports","<p>I am fairly new to spacy / textacy and I have a complicated task ahead. Your help is much appreciated.</p>

<p>In a nutshell, from a sentence like ""Did assault paramedic by kicking and pushing him"", I want to establish whether the reported abuse was against a police officer or other worker (ambulance, hospital staff, traffic warden, etc).</p>

<p>The challenges are:
- The language in which the officers write is not standard English, also the sentences have many punctuation and other errors.
- Subject is often omitted from the reports so using 'textacy.extract.subject_verb_object_triples' for example does not work as it cannot find a subject. (also subject is not necessary here as we already know that the individual has been charged with the abuse, we only want to know what category worker they assaulted from the text provided)
- The text can comprise of a number of sentences that give other context to the crime or it might list a number of abuse charges to multiple types of workers in one text.</p>

<p>Examples:
1. ""Did shout, swear and threaten her neighbours, assault A Police Officer.""
2. ""Did get ejected from a liecenced premises thereafter act aggressively towards his wife and push her.Did act in an aggressive threatening manner towards door staff and other persons.Did resist arrest.Did assault Police by biting and kicking.""
3. ""Accused did punch PC Smith then in the execution of his duty by throwing a punch towards his face to his non injury.""
4. ""Did throw a mobile phone at witness constable Smith""</p>

<p>What I am expecting to get is something like VERB,OBJECT (punch, PC Smith) which would then need to be learned to mean yes, this is a police officer. The compound objects could be PC (Police Constable), Sgt (Sargent), etc</p>

<p>I tried this:</p>

<pre><code>import spacy
import textacy


nlp = spacy.load('en')
text = nlp(u'Did assault paramedic by kicking and pushing him')

text_ext = textacy.extract.subject_verb_object_triples(text)
</code></pre>

<p>But that only works after adding a subject (which i do not need), as well as 'the' in front of the object (paramedic). So the sentence becomes ""Accused did assault the paramedic by kicking and pushing him). I have 55k statements to begin with so correcting the language is not feasible.</p>

<p>How can I work this issue? Thanks</p>

Can I pre-trained BERT model from scratch using tokenized input file and custom vocabulary file for Khmer language,"<p>I would like to know if it's possible for me to use my own tokenized/segmented documents (with my own vocab file as well) as the input file to the <code>create_pretraining_data.py</code> script (git source: <a href=""https://github.com/google-research/bert"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/google-research/bert</a>).   </p>

<p>The main reason for this question is because the segmentation/tokenization for the Khmer language is different than that of English. </p>

<pre><code>Original:
វា​មាន​មក​ជាមួយ​នូវ

Segmented/Tokenized:
វា មាន មក ជាមួយ នូវ
</code></pre>

<p>I tried something on my own and managed to get some results after running the <code>create_pretraining_data.py</code> and <code>run_pretraining.py</code> script.  However, I'm not sure if what I'm doing can be considered correct.  </p>

<p>I also would like to know the method that I should use to verify my model.  </p>

<p>Any help is highly appreciated!  </p>

<h2>Script Modifications</h2>

<p>The modifications that I did were:</p>

1. Make input file in a list format

<p>Instead of a normal plain text, my input file is from my custom Khmer tokenization output where I then make it into a list format, mimicking the output that I get when running the sample English text.</p>

<pre><code>[[['ដំណាំ', 'សាវម៉ាវ', 'ជា', 'ប្រភេទ', 'ឈើ', 'ហូប', 'ផ្លែ'],  
['វា', 'ផ្តល់', 'ផប្រយោជន៍', 'យ៉ាង', 'ច្រើន', 'ដល់', 'សុខភាព']],  
[['cmt', '$', '270', 'នាំ', 'លាភ', 'នាំ', 'សំណាង', 'ហេង', 'ហេង']]]
</code></pre>

<p><em>* The outer bracket indicates a source file, the first nested bracket indicates a document and the second nested bracket indicates a sentence. Exactly the same structure as the variable <code>all_documents</code> inside the <code>create_training_instances()</code> function</em></p>

2. Vocab file from unique segmented words

<p>This is the part that I'm really really having some serious doubt with. To create my vocab file, all I did was find the unique tokens from the whole documents. I then add the core token requirement <code>[CLS], [SEP], [UNK] and [MASK]</code>. I'm not sure if this the correct way to do it.  </p>

<p>Feedback on this part is highly appreciated!</p>

3. Skip tokenization step inside the create_training_instances() function

<p>Since my input file already matches what the variable <code>all_documents</code> is, I skip line 183 to line 207. I replaced it with reading my input as-is:</p>

<pre><code>  for input_file in input_files:
      with tf.gfile.GFile(input_file, ""r"") as reader:
          lines = reader.read()
      all_documents = ast.literal_eval(lines)
</code></pre>

<h2>Results/Output</h2>

<p>The raw input file (before custom tokenization) is from random web-scraping.  </p>

<p>Some information on the raw and vocab file:</p>

<pre><code>Number of documents/articles: 5
Number of sentences: 78
Number of vocabs: 649 (including [CLS], [SEP] etc.)
</code></pre>

<p>Below is the output (tail end of it) after running the  <code>create_pretraining_data.py</code></p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/eoW3p.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/eoW3p.png"" alt=""create_pretraining_data_khmer_output""></a></p>

<p>And this is what I get after running the <code>run_pretraining.py</code></p>

<p><img src=""https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24283367/69701076-06944b00-1127-11ea-9845-318a0c9520ca.PNG"" alt=""20191119_sample_4""></p>

How to compute efficiently an orthogonality vector ? (NLP),"<p>this is my first question here so I am sorry if I am not doing this right.</p>

<p>So, I have a problem computing an orthogonality matrix. I mean, I want to compute an array, similar to co-occurrence matrix, but not having co-occurrences: I want occurrences alone. The array has to be of size <em>(number of words, number of words)</em>, and I am fully aware that this array will be very sparse.</p>

<p>The problem begins with the fact that the 'count' function has to differenciate words on the right and words on the left of the target within a window of 5 words: this is problem number 1. How to do this efficiently ? Here is my code for that :
<em>brokensentence is how I named my tokenized text</em></p>

<pre><code>import collections 
def contextDefiner(word,brokensentence,side):
    brokensentence = np.array(brokensentence)
    count = collections.Counter()
    if side == 'right':
        context = [[b,c,d,e,f] for (a,b,c,d,e,f) in  
                   zip(brokensentence[:],brokensentence[1:],brokensentence[2:],brokensentence[3:],brokensentence[4:],brokensentence[5:]) if a==word]  
    if side == 'left':
        context = [[a,b,c,d,e] for (a,b,c,d,e,f) in 
                   zip(brokensentence[:],brokensentence[1:],brokensentence[2:],brokensentence[3:],brokensentence[4:],brokensentence[5:]) if f==word]
    for ngram in context:
        count.update(ngram)
    return (count)
</code></pre>

<p>OK, now, my second problem with this is that my output is a dictionary. I have to define the context for each word in my vocabulary. This is how I defined my vocabulary :</p>

<pre><code>def vocabularyCreator(corpus):
    vocabulary = sorted(set(wordBreaker(corpus)))
    count=0
    dictionary={}
    for word in vocabulary:
         dictionary[word]=count
         count+=1
    return dictionary
</code></pre>

<p>Now, I have to translate the results for each word into an array. Keep in mind that the indexes of my array have to be the same indexes in my vocabulary. I mean, if the word ""bear"" is the 23rd word in my vocabulary, the context has to be stored in the 23rd row. This is what I did, but it takes SO LONG to compute ! </p>

<pre><code>from scipy import sparse
from scipy.sparse import csr_matrix
from scipy.sparse import lil_matrix

def matrixFiller(vocab,brokensentence,side):
    words = vocab.keys()
    matrix = lil_matrix((len(vocab),len(vocab)))
    for word in words:
        wordindex = vocab.get(word)
        context = contextDefiner(word,brokensentence,side)
        for item in context:
            itemindex = vocab.get(item)
            matrix[wordindex,itemindex]=context.get(item)
    return sparse.csr_matrix(matrix)
</code></pre>

<p>I think that a better idea would be to define the context on the left (or the right) for each word at the same time, instead of having my contextDefiner function iterate *(number of words)** times. But how to do that ? Also, I would need it to be the most efficient possible, because I have to work on a large corpus of texts.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense, and that you will be able to help me !
Thank you so much. Tell me if you need anything else to understand my problem !

Ask dynamic questions for information acquisition,"<p>I am developing a chatbot that asks the user the information that is not there in the database. </p>

<p>So, the questions can be 
""What is our name?""
""Why do you like Paris?""
""Name four places in Paris that you like the most?""</p>

This achieves bidirectional alignment.
It means the first word of english 'modern' maps to the first word of hindi 'AddhUnIk' and vice versa. Here even characters are take as words as they also are an integral part of bidirectional mapping. Thus if you observe the hindi WORD '.' has a null alignment and it maps to nothing with respect to the English sentence as it doesn't have a full stop.

<li>It's restful distributed app, so it's easy to hook up</li>
<li>I've spent some time with it, so using could save me time.</li>
</ol>

<h3>Can I use Solr?</h3>

<p>Although the above reasons are good, I don't know SOLR THAT well, so I need to know if it would be appropriate for my requirements.</p>

<h3>Ideal Usage</h3>

<p>Ideally, I'd like to configure SOLR, and then be able to send SOLR some text, and retrieve the indexed tonkenized content.</p>

<h3>Context</h3>

The dictionaries sometimes can have less coverage for my data set (even BPE based ones), and sometimes miss important words as unknowns. What are the best ways to customize the pretrained models to a dictionary learned from my own data set? For example, some way to transfer learn, like unfreezing the encoder layers and retraining? </p>

What approach is best for urgency detection in a statement (Natural Language Processing)?,"<p>I am working on this problem where i need to understand how urgent it is to respond to a mail. My goal is such that this system should work in any case, meaning the focus must be on the words that show urgency instead of domain specific. </p>

Sequence translation mapping proper nouns to entity types,"<p>I'm trying to perform a sequence to sequence translation with biological scientific text which has a LOT of proper nouns in it into a structured language for biology. I can pretty easily tag the terms (proteins, chemical compounds, etc) with their entity types. </p>

<p>I was wondering if there is a way to replace the nouns with their entity types (in a way that would let me match and add them back after translation) or annotate them in a way that would enhance the translation process. </p>

<p>For example, converting ""Simvastatin-induced apoptosis is accompanied by specific induction of caveolin-1 expression"" to ""simvastin increases rna expression of caveolin-1""  - simvastin == compound, caveolin-1 == RNA   </p>

<p>My expectation is that I would need less training data if I could pre-process the input sentences, but only if I can convert "" induced apoptosis is accompanied by specific induction of  expression"" in a way that I can match up the original entities in the output (easy with one entity of each type, but what happens if I have multiple compounds or RNA's?).</p>

Python - Search large list of keywords in a large unstructured data,"<p>I have large bag of keywords that I want to search in large unstructured data and auto-tag this content.</p>

How to do a Python split() on languages (like Chinese) that don&#39;t use whitespace as word separator?,"<p>I want to split a sentence into a list of words.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>Obviously that doesn't work.</p>

<p>How do I split such a sentence into a list of words?</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>So far the answers seem to suggest that this requires natural language processing techniques and that the word boundaries in Chinese are ambiguous. I'm not sure I understand why. The word boundaries in Chinese seem very definite to me. Each Chinese word/character has a corresponding unicode and is displayed on screen as an separate word/character.</p>

<p>So where does the ambiguity come from. As you can see in my Python console output Python has no problem telling that my example sentence is made up of 5 characters:</p>

<pre><code>这 - u8fd9
是 - u662f
一 - u4e00
个 - u4e2a
句 - u53e5
子 - u5b50

Best approach to feature engineering in natural language processing?,"<p>I am trying to cluster a large corpus of documents and would like to also subsequently explain what characterises each cluster in terms of the most common shared keywords or key-phrases in each cluster. To make clustering feasible, I will use a dimensionality reduction method like for example LSA (SVD) or doc2vec.</p>

<p>I can see several possible paths to the dimensionality reduced feature matrix:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>POS-tagging, chunking (shallow parsing) for nounal phrases (NPs), TF-IDF, LSA (SVD)</p></li>
<li><p>n-grams, TF-IDF, LSA (SVD)</p></li>
<li><p>doc2vec all the way.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>What are some of the advantages and disadvantages of these and perhaps other approaches? And what is ultimately the best way to go?</p>

A PHP Library / Class to Count Words in Various Languages?,"<p>Some time in the near future I will need to implement a cross-language word count, or if that is not possible, a cross-language character count.</p>

Confusion between adjective and participle,"<p>Consider the three sentences: 1. The experienced pain is acute. 2. Experienced candidates are invited to apply. 3. This candidate is experienced in all phases of SDLC.</p>

<p>In sentence 1, what is actually meant is: ""the pain that is experienced"" and not, repeat not, ""pain having experience"". In sentences 2 and 3, what is meant is: ""candidates having experience"".</p>

<p>In sentence 1, the word 'experienced' does not work as an adjective but works as a participle. In sentences 2 and 3, the word essentially functions as an adjective.</p>

<p>However, the Stanford POS-Tagger does exactly the opposite: it tags the word as ""JJ"" in sentence 1 and ""VBN"" in sentences 2 and 3.</p>

<p>The problem seems to arise mainly because the word 'experience' in English is both a noun and a verb.</p>

matching high number of different sentences (using regexp patterns parsing),"<p>I want to use <strong>regexps</strong> to build a text sentence classifier (for a chatbot natural language processing).</p>

<p>I have a very large number (e.g. <strong>>> 100</strong>) of different kind of text sentences to match regexps patterns. </p>

<p>When a sentence matches a regexp (say, an <em>intent</em>), activates a specific <em>action</em> (a function handler).</p>

<p>I preset specific regexps to match any different different set of sentences, by example: </p>

<pre><code>     // I have a long list of regexps (also many regexp for a many intents)

    const regexps = [ 
      /from (?&lt;fromCity&gt;.+)/,  // ---&gt; actionOne()
      /to (?&lt;toCity&gt;.+)/,      // ---&gt; actionTwo()
      /.../,                   // ---&gt; anotherAction()
      /.../                   // ---&gt; yetAnotherAction()
    ]

   // I have a long list of actions (function handlers)

   const actions = [
     actionOne(),
     actionTwo(),
     ...,
     ...
   ]      
</code></pre>

<p><strong>How can I build the fastest (multi-regexp) classifier (in Javascript)?</strong> </p>

<p>My current quick and dirty solution is to just check each regexp sequentially:</p>

<pre><code>    // at run time        
    ...
    sentence = 'from Genova'
    ...

    if (sentence.match(/from (?&lt;fromCity&gt;.+)/)
      actionOne()

    else if(sentence.match(/to (?&lt;toCity&gt;.+)/)
      actionTwo()

    else if ...
    else if ...
    else 
      fallback()
</code></pre>

<p>The above <em>if-then sequence</em> approach is not much scalable and above all is slow in term of performances (even if most frequency-used regexp sort could help). </p>

<p>An alternative approach to improve performances could be:
to create <strong>a <em>single</em> (big) regexp composed by named group (one for each matcher-regexp) alternation</strong>?</p>

<p>As in the minimal example:</p>

<pre><code>   const regexp = /(?&lt;one&gt;from (?&lt;toCity&gt;.+))|(?&lt;two&gt;to (?&lt;toCity&gt;.+))/
</code></pre>

<p>So I create the <em>regexp classifier</em> simply with (please take the code here below as javascript pseudo-code):</p>

<pre><code>    // at build time

    // I collect all possible regexps, each one as a named group
    const intents = [
      '(?&lt;one&gt;from (?&lt;fromCity&gt;.+))',
      '(?&lt;two&gt;to (?&lt;toCity&gt;.+))',
      '...',
      '...'
    ]

    const classifier = new RegExp(intents.join('|'))

    // collection of functions handlers, one for each regexp
    const Actions = {
     'one': 'actionOne',
     'two': 'actionTwo',
     ...,
     ...
    }

    // at run time

    const match = sentence.match(classifier)

    // if match, call corresponding function handler
    // match.groups contains the matching named group
    const action = Actions[match.groups]

    if ( action )
      action()
    else
      fallback() // no match
</code></pre>

<p>Does it make sense?

<p>With Python 3, I've been able to format all the info of invariable length into a formatted sentence, which is all but the last two fields. I'm having difficulty in thinking of an efficient way to unparse (correct me if this is the wrong term to use here) the fifth and sixth fields, the pitches and the events that occurred, due to their variable length and wide variety of things that can occur. </p>

<p>I think I could write out all the rules based on the info on the Retrosheet website, but I'm looking for suggestions for a smarter way to do this. I wrote natural language processing as tags, hoping this could be a trivial problem in that field. Any pointers will be greatly appreciated!</p>

Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing,"<p>Assume you know a student who wants to study Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing.</p>

<p>What specific computer science subjects should they focus on and which programming languages are specifically designed to solve these types of problems?</p>

<p>I am not looking for your favorite subjects and tools, but rather industry standards.</p>

<p><b>Example</b>: I'm guessing that knowing Prolog and Matlab might help them.  They also might want to study Discrete Structures*, Calculus, and Statistics.</p>

<p>*Graphs and trees. Functions: properties, recursive definitions, solving recurrences. Relations: properties, equivalence, partial order. Proof techniques, inductive proof. Counting techniques and discrete probability.  Logic: propositional calculus, first-order predicate calculus. Formal reasoning: natural deduction, resolution. Applications to program correctness and automatic reasoning. Introduction to algebraic structures in computing.</p>

Text analysis problems with german grammar,"<p>How do solutions like DeepL deal with the german grammar, especially with partical verbs that are consisting of two parts. I want to use the Apple NLP for text analysis and it works great for detecting nouns, adjectives and verbs but if there is a partical verb with 2 parts in the beginning and the end of the sentence it will not detect them as one verb. But DeepL does that. </p>

<p>For example the word ""Anfangen"" (to  start) is a German particle verb. Consisting of two parts, a base verb (“fangen”) and particle (“an”). But ""fangen"" as a single word means to catch. So NLP need to check that there is a particle in the sentence that belongs to ""fangen"". It's hard to explain. Or is it all about machine learning?</p>

Part of Speech Tagging - where to start?,"<p>Hello I would like to know how to implement the solution to such a task:</p>

<p>There's a 500Mb file of plain English texts.<br><br></p>

<p>I'd like to collect the statistics about the frequency of words,
but additionally to be sure that each word is recognized correctly (or the majority of words).<br></p>

<p>In terms that 'cry' in the sentence ""she gave a loud CRY"" would 
be classified as a noun and ""Do not cry"" would give a verb to the statistics.</p>

<p>Also, it would be good to filter proper names, so that they formed another dictionary.</p>

<p>The other task would be more difficult. I would like to find the occurences of words that
come together quite often and to build the list of such occurences.</p>

<p>Let's say, ""green grass"", ""beautiful girl"", ""handle carefully"", ""you are right"".
So that we could say exactly, what word sequences are often used together in the language.</p>

<p>HOW WOULD I START? Are there open Java tools &amp; good books on the subject?</p>

List of &quot;regular&quot; english words,"<p>So I found these 3 resources:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/dwyl/english-words"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">479k english words</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://gist.github.com/h3xx/1976236"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">100k most popular english words from Wiktionary</a></li>
<li><a href=""https://github.com/first20hours/google-10000-english"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Google's most frequent 10,000 words</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I don't mind that in the list of 479k words there are words like <code>b</code> and <code>u</code> (words of which I've never seen), because this includes super obscure stuff. But what I'm surprised to find is that the Wiktionary frequent list includes these words:</p>

<pre><code>b
be
bel
bl
bleu
bu
eu
l
lb
le
leu
lu
lub
</code></pre>

<p>In addition, the wiki list <em>doesn't</em> include these words!</p>

<pre><code>lube
neg
tab
</code></pre>

<p>That is, there are many words that the wiki list has that I wouldn't think of as ""regular words"", and there are many ""regular words"" that the wiki list doesn't have.</p>

<p>So my question is if there is a list of ""regular"" words for download on the web in the public domain. By regular, I just mean words that you learn through reading books and such, not these words like <code>leu</code> and <code>bl</code> which for some reason are in the wiki featured list.</p>

<p>This is for an autocomplete component.</p>

How to get phrase-level sentiment from Stanford Core NLP package,"<p>This might not be a very relevant question to this community. But I thought it would let me reach out to the wider computer science community and get help.</p>

<p>I am using the Stanford Core NLP package, more specifically the <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/sentiment/index.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Sentiment module</a> of it. I am getting sentence level sentiment by using the following command. </p>

<pre><code>java -cp stanford-corenlp-3.4.jar:stanford-corenlp-3.4-models.jar:xom.jar:joda-time.jar:jollyday.jar:ejml-0.23.jar -mx2g edu.stanford.nlp.sentiment.SentimentPipeline -stdin &lt; input.txt
</code></pre>

<p>But I need the phrase-level sentiment, like we see in the <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu:8080/sentiment/rntnDemo.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">online demo</a>. I am not being able to figure out how.</p>

<p>EDIT: </p>

<p>After looking into the source code, I figured that just by adding another argument to the above-mentioned command, it is possible to get sentiment score for each node of the parse tree representation of a sentence. However, this gives only a numeric sentiment score as opposed to a positive/negative sentiment. But I think it is fairly trivial to translate this score to a binary positive/negative sentiment. The command is:</p>

<pre><code>java -cp stanford-corenlp-3.4.jar:stanford-corenlp-3.4-models.jar:xom.jar:joda-time.jar:jollyday.jar:ejml-0.23.jar -mx2g edu.stanford.nlp.sentiment.SentimentPipeline -stdin -output PENNTREES &lt; input.txt

does python3 nltk word_tokenize() have a string length limit?,"<p>I have a dictionary consisting of a database primary key with a string.  </p>

<pre><code>self.mydict = {
1:'a small example'
,2:'some sentence'
,3:'a very long string around 30k characters'
}
</code></pre>

<p>For key value pairs where the string is length&lt;1000, everything tokenizes as I would expect.<br>
For a few very large strings (length=30,000), the tokenizer returns multiple broken lines in my csv output.</p>

<pre><code>def write_data(self):
    headers=[]
    for x,y in self.mydict.items():
        headers.append([word_tokenize(y)])
        print(len(y))

    with open(self.outputdata, 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as f:
        writer = csv.writer(f)
        for item in headers:
            writer.writerow(item)
</code></pre>

<p>Writing my results to a csv, I get the following:  </p>

<pre><code>['a','small','example']
['some','sentence']
['a','very','long',
string','around','30k','characters']""
</code></pre>

<p>So the 30k length string breaks for some reason, and appears to split onto another line. I can truncate the first ~1000 characters of the strings and this problem goes away, but I'd prefer to keep the long strings as I'm doing natural language processing. Is this bug due to the length of the string or the way I'm writing my csv?</p>

Special characters training NLP models,"<p>I just started with NLP in bots, where a user ask a question that is classified by LUIS and then forwarded to QnAMaker to get an answer, and I have noticed that it behaves strangely with Spanish since we have accented characters and double question marks (¿?). For example:</p>

<pre><code>[1] ¿qué es NLP?
[2] que es NLP
</code></pre>

<p>If I train my model with the first one and test it with the second one, the model won't identify both of them with the same intent. This is a very common way to communicate in Spanish since some people tend to save time by avoiding accented charactes and punctuation.</p>

<p>My questions are: </p>

<ul>
<li>Should I normalize every utterance in my model (removing accents,
punctuation, etc.)? Or should I train it with every different example?</li>
<li>Are there any guidelines for training NLP models that I can base my work in?</li>

How to compute the perplexity in text classification?,"<p>I'm doing dialect text classification with scikit learn, naive bayes and countvectorizer. So far I'm only doing 3 dialects text classification. I'm going to add a new dialect(or actually, the formal language for those dialects). The problem is, the new text that I'm going to add, shares a lot of words with the other 3 dialects. So I read the following in a research document:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We train an n-gram model for each dialect from the collected data. To
  train the MSA model, we select sentences from Arabic UN corpus and
  news collections. All the dialect and MSA models share the same
  vocabulary, thus perplexity can be compared properly. At
  classification time, given an input sentence, the classifier computes
  the perplexity for each dialect type and choose the one with minimum
  perplexity as the label.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>They mean by MSA(Modern Standard Arabic) which is the formal language for those dialects. How are they  calculating the perplexity? Are they just using naive bayes or there's more to it?</p>

Multi-intent natural language processing and classification,"<p>So, I'm making my own home assistant and I'm trying to make a multi-intent classification system. However, I cannot find a way to split the query said by the user into the multiple different intents in the query.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre><code>I have my data for one of my intents (same format for all) 

{""intent_name"": ""music.off"" , ""examples"": [""turn off the music"" , ""kill 
the music"" , ""cut the music""]}
</code></pre>

<p>and the query said by the user would be:</p>

<p><code>'dim the lights, cut the music and play Black Mirror on tv'</code></p>

<p>I want to split the sentence into their individual intents such as :</p>

<p><code>['dim the lights', 'cut the music', 'play black mirror on tv']</code></p>

<p>however, I can't just use <code>re.split</code> on the sentence with <code>and</code> and <code>,</code> as delimiters to split with as if the user asks :</p>

<p><code>'turn the lights off in the living room, dining room, kitchen and bedroom'</code> </p>

<p>this will be split into </p>

<p><code>['turn the lights off in the living room', 'kitchen', 'dining room', 'bedroom']</code></p>

<p>which would not be usable with my intent detection</p>

<p>this is my problem, thank you in advance</p>

<h2>UPDATE</h2>

<p>okay so I've got this far with my code, it can get the examples from my data and identify the different intents inside as I wished however it is not splitting the parts of the original query into their individual intents and is just matching. </p>

<pre><code>import nltk
import spacy
import os
import json
#import difflib
#import substring
#import re
#from fuzzysearch import find_near_matches
#from fuzzywuzzy import process

text = ""dim the lights, shut down the music and play White Collar""

    for root, dirs, files in os.walk(""./data""):  

        for filename in files:

            f = open(f""./data/{filename}"" , ""r"")
            file_ = f.read()
            data = json.loads(file_)

            choices.append(data[""examples""])

        for set_ in choices:

            command = process.extract(text, set_ , limit=1)

    print(f""all commands : {commands}"")

<p>this returns <code>[('dim the lights') , ('turn off the music') , ('play Black Mirror')]</code> which is the correct intents but I have no way of knowing which part of the query relates to each intent - this is the main problem</p>

<p>(2) How can I provide my own corpus and point to it as a param?</p>

<p>(3) Can TF-IDF be used at a sentence level? ie: what is the relative frequency of this sentence's terms against the corpus.</p>

Breaking a command into components using Natural Language Processing,"<p>I want to convert a variable assignment command into code. For example:
""create a variable alpha equal to the number 7"" or
""define a new variable alpha and set it to 7"", and either should convert into:</p>

Once I figure out that the variable name is ""alpha"" and the variable value is ""7"", I can construct the code seen above. But how would I go about finding the variable name and variable value through natural language processing? The user might add extra words or omit some words (or maybe even invert the order).</p>

"should I build own NLP engine for rare language or use cloud services for chatbots (azure, GCP) and translations?","<p>So, I would like to build a <code>chatbot</code> for a language not widely supported (i.e. <code>goole</code>/<code>azure</code> don't have support for building chatbots, but only translation service).

<li>To translate user questions to English and then internally use chatbot engine which supports English (of course, the chatbot needs to be
    programmed), i.e. azure/GCP engines. When context is recognized, and
    when used provide answer (it can again be translated to destination 
    language toward user) ?</li>

Bi-LSTM: How to handle unigram and bigrams for a NLP classification?,"<p>I have a chinese text and I use a Bi-LSTM to predict if each character of the text belongs to one of these classes: </p>

<p>B (if the charatcer is at the beginning of the word), 
I (if it is inside the word), 
E (if it is at the end of the word)
S (if it is a single character).</p>

<p>For doing this, I have taken each character of the text and I have built a dictionary, thanks to this I was able to transform the sequence of characters into a sequences of numbers that I give to my network (after the phase of padding), for example:</p>

<p>dictionary={t:1, h:2, e:3, p:4, n:5}
The pen -> 123 435 -> network -> BIE BIE</p>

<p>Everything is ok if I'm working with unigram. However, my network should read also bigrams. How should I handle bigrams? I don't have specific labels for bigrams. (Maybe, my network for each bigram should gives two labels? It doesn't make sense to me)</p>

English word segmentation in NLP?,"<p>I am new in the NLP domain, but my current research needs some text parsing (or called keyword extraction) from URL addresses, e.g. a fake URL,</p>

<p>Two constraints are put on my parsing,</p>
<ol>
<li><p>The first &quot;ads&quot; and last &quot;heads&quot; should be distinct because &quot;ads&quot; in the &quot;heads&quot; means more suffix rather than an advertisement.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The &quot;appid&quot; can be parsed into two parts; that is 'app' and 'id', both taking semantic meanings on the Internet.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>I have tried the <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/lex-parser.shtml"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Stanford NLP</a> toolkit and Google search engine.

The Google engine shows more smartness about &quot;appid&quot; which gives me suggestions about &quot;app id&quot;.</p>
<p>I can not look over the reference of search history in Google search so that it gives me &quot;app id&quot; because there are many people have searched these words. Can I get some offline line methods to perform similar parsing??</p>

"Efficient Context-Free Grammar parser, preferably Python-friendly","<p>I am in need of parsing a small subset of English for one of my project, described as a context-free grammar with (1-level) feature structures (<a href=""http://code.google.com/p/nltk/source/browse/trunk/nltk/examples/grammars/book_grammars/feat0.fcfg?r=8260"">example</a>) and I need to do it efficiently .</p>

<p>Right now I'm using <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"">NLTK</a>'s parser which produces the right output but is very slow. For my grammar of ~450 fairly ambiguous non-lexicon rules and half a million lexical entries, parsing simple sentences can take anywhere from 2 to 30 seconds, depending it seems on the number of resulting trees. Lexical entries have little to no effect on performance.</p>

<p>Another problem is that loading the (25MB) grammar+lexicon at the beginning can take up to a minute.</p>

<p>From what I can find in literature, the running time of the algorithm used to parse such a grammar (Earley or CKY) should be linear to the size of the grammar and cubic to the size of the input token list. My experience with NLTK indicates that ambiguity is what hurts the performance most, not the absolute size of the grammar.</p>

<p>So now I'm looking for a CFG parser to replace NLTK. I've been considering <a href=""http://www.dabeaz.com/ply/"">PLY</a> but I can't tell whether it supports feature structures in CFGs, which are required in my case, and the examples I've seen seem to be doing a lot of procedural parsing rather than just specifying a grammar. Can anybody show me an example of PLY both supporting feature structs and using a declarative grammar?</p>

<p>I'm also fine with any other parser that can do what I need efficiently. A Python interface is preferable but not absolutely necessary.</p>

How to obtain enhanced dependency parsing from Stanford NLP tools?,"<p>I'm working on a project about dependency parsing for Polish. We’re trying to train the Stanford Neural Network Dependency Parser on data from Polish language (using Universal Dependencies treebanks in .conllu format).

So far we’ve been able to achieve some success with pl_lfg-ud Treebank in standard dependencies, by running the parser from the command line. But we would also like to train the parser to reproduce the enhanced Universal Dependencies, which are represented in the treebank as well. So far I have not been able to find a way to do so in the
documentation, and FAQ for both NNDEP and CORE NLP, even though, as far as I understand, it is possible with Stanford NLP parser. Is it the case that the enhanced dependencies parsing works only for English (or other officially supported langauges), or am I simply doing something wrong?</p>

Classifying Text Based on Groups of Keywords?,"<p>I have a list of requirements for a software project, assembled from the remains of its predecessor.

The results would be use as a starting point to further categorize the requirements.</p>

<p>As an example, suppose I have the requirement:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The system shall apply deposits to a customer's specified account.</p>

The root cause is that my POS tagger gives me ADV for 'kochst' while should VVFIN or at least V... since this is a verb.</p>

<p>I also found that original TIGER corpus file doesn't contain 'kochst' form but only 'kocht'.</p>

<p>I am not familiar with conll format, but have added one additional row which is shown below</p>

<pre><code>50475_11    kochst  kochen  _   VVFIN   _   number=sg|person=2|tense=pres|mood=ind  _   0   _   --  _   _   _   _
</code></pre>

<p>and retrained the tagger without any success, see listing below</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; import nltk
&gt;&gt;&gt; corp = nltk.corpus.ConllCorpusReader('.', 'tiger_release_aug07.corrected.16012013.conll09',
...                                      ['ignore', 'words', 'ignore', 'ignore', 'pos'],
...                                      encoding='utf-8')
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tagged_sents = corp.tagged_sents()
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; from ClassifierBasedGermanTagger.ClassifierBasedGermanTagger import ClassifierBasedGermanTagger
&gt;&gt;&gt; tagger = ClassifierBasedGermanTagger(train=tagged_sents)
&gt;&gt;&gt; tagger.tag(['kochst'])
[('kochst', u'ADV')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; 
&gt;&gt;&gt; tagged_sents[-1]
[(u'kochst', u'VVFIN')]
</code></pre>

<p>So it might be I added 'kochst' record incorrectly or TIGER corpus is not complete (I found that many verbs in second person form are not there) or I simply don't understand something here, how to train POS tagger to return verb for conjugated verbs.</p>

<p>'kochst' just an example,  I guess there a lot other verbs cannot be recognized</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; tagger.tag(['fahre'])
[('fahre', u'XY')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; tagger.tag(['musst'])
[('musst', u'PPER')]

"If a small neural network were used as a scoring function for Attention model, what label/value it is trained against?","<p>I am reading up a paper on Attention mechanism of encoder-decoder architecture for machine translation. There were several proposals for the scoring function for decoding step, such as cosine similarity (between an encoder state and a decoder state), simple dot-product, etc... One of them is using a neural network to train to get a score. But what i don't get is what are we going to train it against? By that I mean the output ""Y"" label/value.

"Fasttext representation for short phrase, but not for longer phrase containing the short one","<p>I'm using <code>Gensim</code> for loading the german <code>.bin</code> files from <code>Fasttext</code> in order to get vector representations for out-of-vocabulary words and phrases. So far it works fine and I achieve good results overall.<br>
I am familiar with the <code>KeyError :'all ngrams for word &lt;word&gt; absent from model'.</code> Clearly the model doesn't provide a vector representation for every possible ngram combination.<br>
But now I ran into a confusing (at least for me) issue.<br>
I'll just give a quick example:<br>
the model provides a representation for the phrase <code>AuM Wert</code>.<br>
But when I want to get a representation for <code>AuM Wert 50 Mio. Eur</code>, I'll get the <code>KeyError</code> mentioned above. So the model obviously has a representation for the shorter phrase but not for the extended one.<br>
It even returns a representation for <code>AuM Wert 50 Mio.Eur</code> (I just removed the space between 'Mio' and 'Eur')<br>
I mean, the statement in the Error is simply not true, because the first example shows that it knows some of the ngrams. Can someone explain that to me? What don't I understand here? Is my understanding of ngrams wrong?</p>

<p>Heres the code: </p>

<pre><code>from gensim.models.wrappers import FastText
model = FastText.load_fasttext_format('cc.de.300.bin')
model.wv['AuM Wert'] #returns a vector
model.wv['AuM Wert 50 Mio.EUR'] #returns a vector

Swift NSLinguisticTagger results for languages other than English,"<p>I'm currently checking out Swift's NSLinguisticTagger. For test purposes I used the code from appcoda <a href=""https://www.appcoda.com/natural-language-processing-swift/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Introduction to Natural Language Processing</a>.</p>

<p>For the English language it works as expected and described in the tutorial. But when I use NSLinguisticTagger on languages other than English the Lemmatization, Parts of Speech and Named Entity Recognition produces no useful results. I can understand this for the Named Entity Recognition but for the first two options I thought at least a basic result should be possible. Did I miss a language specific setting or is NSLinguisticTagger only good for language detection and Tokenization when used for languages other than English?</p>

<p>Here's the code Sai Kambampati uses in his tutorial:</p>

<pre><code>import Foundation

<p>only the language detection and the tokenization seems to work correct. For the Parts of Speech Tagging only ""OtherWord"" and for the Named Entity Recognition no result at all is returned:</p>

<p>Did anyone tried to use the Class in other languages than English or is it only seriously usable when working with English text.

Why the classifier gives me the input without any changes,"<p>I'm trying to build a classifier that segment Arabic sentences (transliterated in Buckwalter). I have attributes that read from files and I'm applying +/- 10 context window (i.e. for each word, I check 10 words before and 10 words after). The classification classes are:</p>

<p>B-S for the first word of the sentence, 
E-S for the last word of the sentence, 
I-S represents words in the middle,
and S for sentences that contain only one word. </p>

<pre><code>FastVector fClasse = new FastVector();
fClasse.addElement( ""I-S"" );
fClasse.addElement( ""B-S"" );
fClasse.addElement( ""E-S"" );
fClasse.addElement( ""S"" );

if (str.length == 1) {
    element.setValue( attClasse , ""S"" );
} else {
    if (i == 0) {
        element.setValue( attClasse , ""B-S"" );
    } else {
        if (i == str.length - 1) {
            element.setValue( attClasse , ""E-S"" );

How to Properly Decode Hex Values in RTF,"<p>Unfortunately this one goes down two rabbit holes, text encodings and RTF. But here it is.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am working on an NLP text pipeline where we need to convert RTF to plain text, in other words we need to remove the RTF control characters and leave the text content intact. We are building the pipeline in python and it has several requirements that prevent us from using something like Apache Tikka in production. </p>

<p>I know that RTF can contain hex values such as <code>\'a9</code> if the author of the document typed a non-ascii character. I also know that the first sequence of control characters in the document specifies how to decode these hex values, e.g. <code>\ansicpg1252</code>. For example, in this case the presence of <code>\ansicpg1252</code> at the beginning of the document means that <code>\'a9</code> should be interpreted as unicode code point <code>00A9 (COPYRIGHT SIGN)</code> as per <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows-1252"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">the windows-1252 encoding</a>.</p>

<h2>Question</h2>

<p>I came across an RTF document with <code>\ansicpg1252</code> in the first set of control characters, however there are several places in the document where the following hex literals appear, <code>\'81\'aa</code>. This is confusing becuase <code>0x81</code> is undefined in the <code>windows-1252</code> encoding. I thought maybe it could be <code>utf-8</code>, however it isn't defined in <code>utf-8</code> either. </p>

<p>WordPad.exe represents these two bytes with this character: ↑</p>

<p>Apache Tikka uses the same character, ↑</p>

<p>This character corresponds to unicode code point <code>2191 (Upwards Arrow)</code>, and as it turns out our mystery bytes, <code>0x81AA</code>, are the result of encoding this character using the <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_page_932_(Microsoft_Windows)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Windows Code Page 932 encoding</a>, which contains Japanese characters.</p>

<p>For reference, the full context of those two bytes in the RTF document is </p>

<pre><code>\plain\f1\fs20 \'81\'aa\plain\f0\fs20
</code></pre>

<p>and the document contains this entry in the <code>\fonttbl</code> group:</p>

<pre><code>{\f1\fmodern\fcharset128\fprq1 MS Mincho;}
</code></pre>

<p>which, as far as I understand, means that any text following <code>\f1</code> should be rendered using the <code>MS Mincho</code> font, which kind of makes sense since <code>MS Mincho</code> contains Japanese glyphs. But how would an RTF parser know that <code>0x81AA</code> should be decoded using <code>Windows Code Page 932</code> and not <code>ansicpg1252</code> as specified in the first line of the file? Do I need to know that certain fonts imply certain encodings? </p>

<p>My best guess is that it has something to do with the part of the <code>\fonttbl</code> entry that says <code>\fcharset128</code>, but I'm not sure.</p>

Fixing Perl errors when I try to pass a hash (by reference) AND a variable to a sub to print the corresponding value in the hash,"<p>I am banging my head over a Perl task in my Natural Language Processing course that we have been assigned to solve.</p>

<p>What they require us to be able to solve with Perl is the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Input: the program takes two inputs from stdin in the form and type of;
  perl program.pl  </p></li>
<li><p>Processing and Output:</p>

<p>Part 1: the program tokenizes words in filename.txt and stores these words in a hash with their frequency of occurrence</p>

<p>Part 2: the program uses the  input for hashing purposes. If the word cannot be found in the hash (thus in the text), prints out zero as the frequency of the word. If the word CAN indeed be
found in the hash, prints out the corresponding frequency value of the word in the hash.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>I am sure from experience that my script is already able to DO ""Part 1"" stated above.</p>

<p>Part 2 needs to be accomplished using a Perl sub (subroutine) which takes the hash by reference, along with the  to hash for. This was the part that I had some serious trouble with.</p>

<p>First version before major changes Stefan Becker suggested;</p>

How can we identify inputs and outputs of a logic gate application problem using Natural Language Processing?,"<p>At the moment I have identified the entities in a given scenario, and I gave it a try to classify inputs entities and output entities using a neighborhood analysis technique for each identified entity. That method is not much accurate, since the way of providing the scenario might change time to time.</p>

<p>For an example:</p>

<ul>
<li>There is a <strong>door</strong>,<strong>window</strong> and a <strong>safe</strong>. The safe is unlocked , if the door
is closed and the window is opened.</li>
</ul>

<p>To find the Boolean expression for this we need to consider the safe, door and the window are entities.Furthermore the safe is an output entity and other two are input entities.</p>

<p>Can anyone suggest me a proper logic using python to identify which are input entities and which are output entities?</p>

How to extract DateTime from German Sentences?,"<p>I am developing a chatbot with the Microsoft Bot Framework with LUIS (language understanding). Since the provided datetime entity is not sufficient I am currently struggeling with the best way how to detect dates in German.

How to use the regular expression to transform the &lt;U+5C16&gt; into \u5c16?,"<p>I am doing a sentiment analysis project and firstly, I need to clean the text data. Some text contains Chinese, Tagalog and what I am doing now is trying to translate them to English. But until now, all the Chinese characters in this datafile have some Unicode representation like:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;U+5C16&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>which could not be coped with using the Python Encoding&amp;Decoding path. So I want to transform this kind of pattern to:</p>

<pre><code>\u5c16
</code></pre>

<p>Then I think we could use the following code to get the Chinese characters I want:</p>

<pre><code>text.encode('latin-1').decode('unicode_escape')
</code></pre>

<p>So the question now is how to use the regex to transform <code>&lt;U+5C16&gt;</code> into<code>\u5c16</code>?</p>

<p>Thank you very much!</p>

<hr>

<p>Update: I think the most difficult thing here is that I need to let the <code>5c16</code> part in <code>\u5c16</code> be equivalent to the lowercase of the <code>5C16</code> in <code>&lt;U+5C16&gt;</code>. And in my social media dataset, what I see most is the text data like the following:</p>

<p><code>&lt;U+5C16&gt;&lt;U+6C99&gt;&lt;U+5480&gt;&lt;U+9418&gt;&lt;U+6A13&gt;</code></p>

<p>If I could transform the above text to <code>'\u5c16\u6c99\u5480\u9418\u6a13'</code> and print it in Python, I could get what I really want:</p>

<pre><code>尖沙咀鐘樓

<p>But how could I do this? Any insights and hints would be appreciated!</p>

How to convert an English string of a number into a float (e.g. &quot;twenty-six&quot;=&gt;26.0),"<p>I'm building a chatbot and I want to be able to parse strings representing numerical amounts that represent a human age.

<p>Examples:</p>

parse(""twenty-five"")      # =&gt; 25.0
parse(""three and a half"") # =&gt; 3.5

Spacy - Intepret text with stripped accents,"<p>I am working with spacy to analyze some text in french.</p>

"Using Python &amp; NLP, how can I extract certain text strings &amp; corresponding numbers preceding the strings from Excel column having a lot of free text?","<p>I am relatively new to Python and very new to NLP (and nltk) and I have searched the net for guidance but not finding a complete solution.

Unless it would simply be easier for you to just help with the scripting... in which case, thank you.</p>

<p>Problem: A few columns of an otherwise robust spreadsheet are very unstructured with anywhere from 500-5000 English characters that tell a story. I need to essentially make it a bit more structured by pulling out the quantifiable data. I need to:</p>

<p>1) Search for a string in the user supplied unstructured free text column (The user inputs the column header) (I think I am doing this right)</p>

<p>2) Make that string a NEW column header in Excel (I think I am doing this right)</p>

<p>3) Grab the number before the string (This is where I am getting stuck. And as you will see in the sheet, sometimes there is no space between the number and text and of course, sometimes there are misspellings)</p>

<p>4) Put that number in the NEW column on the same row (Have not gotten to this step yet)</p>

<p>I will have to do this repeatedly for multiple keywords but I can figure that part out, I believe, with a loop or something. Thank you very much for your time and expertise...</p>

<p>As you can see Jumanpp_wrapper is trying to import the module Jumanpp from pyknp. I have looked into the pyknp package currently installed on my machine and it does not have a module with this name. This leads me to conclude that the version of pyknp I have installed is not compatible with Jumanpp, so there must be another version available somewhere. The trouble is I install pyknp using the pip installer on my Mac, as recommended on the pyknp official site, so it should be the most current version. I'm not sure how to get an alternative version that contains the necessary module. I hope someone can point me in the right direction.</p>

"OpenNLP-Document Categorizer- how to classify documents based on status; language of docs not English, also default features?","<p>I want to classify my documents using OpenNLP's Document Categorizer, based on their status: pre-opened, opened, locked, closed etc.</p>

Creating Words Dictionary and Mapping to other languages,"<p>I am creating an app, where user can search in multiple languages. Let's say I have a website which host a very big novel. may be consisting of thousands of para graphs. some where between 20,000 to 30,000 para graphs. </p>

<p>A user can read the novel in multiple languages. He can search in multiple languages. For example he searches ""LOVE"" in English, I will show him all the paragraphs containing ""LOVE"" in them. </p>

<p>Now, if user switches to French, and searches ""Amour"" (French for Love), I will show him all paragraphs containing ""Amour"" in them. </p>

<p>I can do it by creating two versions of the novel, one in french and other in English. Indeed, I will have the translations. But, when user is reading the novel I will give him an option to click on any word and see it's translation to other languages. In this case, if he is reading in English, I will show him translation of that particular word in French and vise versa. </p>

<p>This means I want to keep a word to word mapping between different languages. </p>

<p>One way of doing is to create a map my self, which is a lot of work. another way could be some API calls, for example Google Translator. 
Can you suggest best approach? Any existing API?

Removing parentheses and everything in them with Regex,"<p>Having a bit of trouble with some code I'm working through.

How is the decoder conditioned in seq2seq learning?,"<p>I am trying to understand sequence-to-sequence learning with a RNN. What I understand so far, is that the output of the encoder is used to condition the decoder. </p>

<p><strong>Source: Neural Network Methods for Natural Language Processing by Yoav Goldberg</strong></p>

<p>As far as I understand the author, the decoder operates in every step with a state vector AND the decoder output AND the next part of the sequence.
Thus, the state vector of the decoder is seperated from the result of the encoder.</p>

<p><strong>Source: A ten-minute introduction to sequence-to-sequence learning in Keras by Francois Chollet</strong></p>

<p>As far as I understand the author and the source, the decoder is provided with the encoder state as intial state.
Thus, the state vector of the decoder is the output of the decoder. The decoder steps only depend on the encoder output through the state vector.</p>

Anyone know of any real systems using Computational Semantics with Lambda Calculus?,"<p>I was wondering if Computational Semantics is actually used in any real-world system?

I would like to see how an actual system works. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It seems like there are a bunch of issues with actually using Computational Semantics in any real world system:</p>
  
  <ul>
  <li>It seems just labeling sentences with part-of-speech tags is error prone.  </li>
  <li>But you also need a reliable parse tree which is error prone and there can be many valid trees for one sentence.  </li>
  <li>Finding what pronouns are referring to what entities is error prone.  </li>
  <li>Word disambiguation is also another source of errors and multiple meanings could be valid in the same context.</li>
  <li>Any context-free-grammar of English I can find seems to be incomplete.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>Finally, after all these sources of error are dodged, we can finally convert the sentence to FOL with Computation Semantics!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Also, I can't seem to figure out how to deal with prepositions in Computation Semantics.</p>

<p>Is this really just an academic exercise or is Computational Semantics actually useful?</p>

Force Stanford CoreNLP Parser to Prioritize &#39;S&#39; Label at Root Level,"<p>Greetings NLP Experts,</p>
<p>I am using the Stanford CoreNLP software package to produce constituency parses, using the most recent version (3.9.2) of the English language models JAR, downloaded from the <a href=""https://stanfordnlp.github.io/CoreNLP/download.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CoreNLP Download page</a>. I access the parser via the Python interface from the NLTK module nltk.parse.corenlp. Here is a snippet from the top of my main module:</p>
<pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.tree import ParentedTree
from nltk.parse.corenlp import CoreNLPParser

parser = CoreNLPParser(url='http://localhost:9000')
</code></pre>
<p>I also fire up the server using the following (fairly generic) call from the terminal:</p>
<pre><code>java -mx4g -cp &quot;*&quot; edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLPServer
-annotators &quot;parse&quot; -port 9000 -timeout 30000
</code></pre>
<p>The parser that CoreNLP selects by default (when the full English model is available) is the Shift-Reduce (SR) parser, which <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/29241123/pcfg-vs-sr-parser"">is sometimes claimed</a> to be both more accurate and faster than the CoreNLP PCFG parser. Impressionistically, I can corroborate that with my own experience, where I deal almost exclusively with Wikipedia text.</p>
<p>However, I have noticed that often the parser will erroneously opt for parsing what is in fact a complete sentence (i.e., a finite, matrix clause) as a subsentential constituent instead, often an <code>NP</code>. In other words, the parser should be outputting an <code>S</code> label at root level <code>(ROOT (S ...))</code>, but something in the complexity of the sentence's syntax pushes the parser to say a sentence is not a sentence <code>(ROOT (NP ...))</code>, etc.</p>
<p>The parses for such problem sentences also always contain another (usually glaring) error further down in the tree. Below are a few examples. I'll just paste in the top few levels of each tree to save space. Each is a perfectly acceptable English sentence, and so the parses should all begin <code>(ROOT (S ...))</code>. However, in each case some other label takes the place of <code>S</code>, and the rest of the tree is garbled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>NP:</strong> An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. <code>(ROOT (NP (NP An estimated 22) (: --) (S 189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold) (. .)))</code></p>
<p><strong>FRAG:</strong> More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance. <code>(ROOT (FRAG (NP (NP More than one-third) (PP of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which has implications for antibiotic resistance)) (. .)))</code></p>
<p><strong>UCP:</strong> Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans, the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species. <code>(ROOT (UCP (S Coffee is a brewed drink prepared from roasted coffee beans) (, ,) (NP the seeds of berries from certain Coffea species) (. .)))</code></p>
</blockquote>
<p>At long last, here is my question, which I trust the above evidence proves is a useful one: <strong>Given that my data contains a negligible number of fragments or otherwise ill-formed sentences, how can I impose a high-level constraint on the CoreNLP parser such that its algorithm gives priority to assigning an <code>S</code> node directly below <code>ROOT</code>?</strong></p>
<p>I am curious to see whether imposing such a constraint when processing data (that one knows to satisfy it) will also cure other myriad ills observed in the parses produced. From what I understand, the solution would not lie in specifying a <code>ParserAnnotations.ConstraintAnnotation</code>. Would it?</p>

How to detect numerical value of a text?,"<p>We have data for survey question (e.g. rate us between 1-5) that's supposed to be numerical. However, we find that the response also includes</p>

<li>Great! </li>
<li>four </li>
<li>3 and a half</li>

<p>I'd like a way to turn the user response into a numerical value. e.g. the text above should translate into 5, 4, 5, 4, 3.5 respectively. Obviously this won't work 100% of the time so I'm looking for an optimal solution (perhaps a text analysis approach) that gets me over 80%. </p>

How to change the end of the text content of an lxml etree.Element in Python3?,"<p>I am currently working on a natural language processing project in Python. We have html texts of scientific articles, which we parse with Pythons lxml.etree, and store as Elements and ElementTrees. Some of our html texts are actually converted pfs using pdf2htmlEX (<a href=""https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/coolwanglu/pdf2htmlEX</a>). This converter turns every row of the article into a div, in a way that strips spaces from endlines.</p>

<p>So this html:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div&gt;This is a&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;div&gt;sample text.&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>... gets parsed like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is asample text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Notice the absence of whitsepace between 'a' and 'sample'.</p>

<p>I need it to look like this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is a sample text.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I have to somehow add the whitespace manually to the end of the line. Etree does have an Element.text attribute, and Element.text can be changed as any other strings could be. Element.text += ' ' results with adding whitespace to the end of the .text. However, .text will only go until the first child tag. Consider the following code:</p>

<pre><code>html = '&lt;div&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt; text.&lt;/div&gt;'
el = etree.fromstring(html)
print(el.text)
</code></pre>

<p>The printed result is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'This is a '</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sadly, Element does not have an attribute to reach the <strong>end</strong> of the text. If you want to use the whole text content of an Element, you need to use ''.join(el.itertext()). Sadly, for a couple of reasons, I need to change the elements text content directly. Storing the results of the itertext and using it in the rest of the code is <strong>not an option</strong> for me at this time.</p>

<p>To add some further challange, there are different variations of the same problem:</p>

<pre><code>html_1 = &lt;div&gt;This is a &lt;strong&gt;sample&lt;/strong&gt; text.&lt;/div&gt;
html_2 = &lt;div&gt;This is a sample &lt;strong&gt;text.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>These are different cases: html_1 has the endline in the div element, while html2 has it in the strong.</p>

<p>Is there a solution where I can add a space to the end of the string in an Element?</p>

<p>My solution works fine for the challenge 3 string, but when I try with challenge 4 I just get garbage out. More disconcertingly, I can't even see the correct string in the collection of strings generated by my XORs (I printed them all to a file). I've tried changing how I extract the strings from the text file (which is why I'm using a less standard method of getting the strings out) with no effect.</p>

<p>Challenge 3's string is ""1b37373331363f78151b7f2b783431333d78397828372d363c78373e783a393b3736"" which should output ""Cooking MC's like a pound of bacon"" which functions correctly. Challenge 4 is a file with 300 odd lines, only one of which is the correct one to decode.

"Gensim Keywords, how to load a german model?","<p>I'm try to get started with the gensim library. My goal is pretty simple. I want to use the keywords extraction provided by gensim on a german text. Unfortunately, i'm failing hard.</p>

<p>Gensim comes with a keywords extraction build in, it is build on TextRank. While the results look good on english text, it seems not to work on german. I simple installed gensim via pypi and used it out of the box. Well such AI Products are usually driven by a model. My guess is that gensim comes with a english model. A word2vec model for german is available on a <a href=""https://github.com/devmount/GermanWordEmbeddings"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">github page</a>.</p>

<p>But here i'm stuck, i can't find a way how the summarization module of gensim, which provides the <a href=""https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/summarization/keywords.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">keywords function</a> i'm looking for, can work with a external model.</p>

<p>So the basic question is, how do i load the german model and get keywords from german text?</p>

<p>Thanks</p>

natural language processing: text corpus format for word2vec,"<p>I found a tutorial that uses word2vec on a large Wikipedia DataSet
<a href=""http://danielfrg.github.io/blog/2013/09/21/word2vec-yhat/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://danielfrg.github.io/blog/2013/09/21/word2vec-yhat/</a><br>
I would like to build a yhat rest API similar to the one he Daniel has demonstrated in his tutorial.</p>

<p>Today I put together some Spanish newspaper articles I wish to analyze. The web-site I retrieved my data formats its articles very regularly, so I have 1000 articles stored as strings, e.g. </p>

<pre><code>""Otros se dan a conocer por la simpleza, como Sonya Cortés, 
quien expresó que atesora compartir en familia y gozar de salud.   
En el ambiente del reggaeton, Khriz, del dúo Ángel &amp; Khriz, 
aprovechará para estrenar su nueva piscina ya que por su agenda 
de trabajo no ha podido darse un chapuzón todavía. Mientras, 
Daddy Yankee se tomará un descanso con la familia luego de una larga gira.""
</code></pre>

<p>I am comfortable with Python and was hoping to use the python wrapper listed in the tutorial:
<a href=""https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec"" rel=""nofollow"">https://github.com/danielfrg/word2vec</a></p>

<p>How do I load my corpus into word2vec?  Right now I have an array of strings.</p>

<p>At the moment my corpus fits into memory.  Is word2vec still the right tool?</p>

Setting path in heidelTime property file to use Stanford POS Tagger for German?,"<p>I am trying to detect temporal information in German text. I tried using the Stanford CoreNLP pipeline as it would be very helpful to make use of dependency parse information in later stages (after temporal tagging) but to my understanding there is no way of setting the integrated temporal tagger of CoreNLP to German. Am I right about this or is there, in fact, a way to  do this.</p>

<p>Now I'm trying to use HeidelTime to retrieve tamporal tags seperately. I want to use the Stanford POS tagger with it. In the Heideltime config.props file, I am setting the path to the Stanford POS tagger like this (using windows): </p>

<pre><code>model_path = C:\\Users\\milu\\Documents\\stanford-postagger-full-2017-06-09\\stanford-postagger-full-2017-06-09\\models
# leave this unset if you do not need one (e.g., /home/jannik/stanford-postagger-full-2014-01-04/tagger.config)
config_path =   
</code></pre>

<p>This is the code I'm running on NetBeans, followed by the error I get. Is there something wrong with the way I am specifying the path to the POS tagger?</p>

<pre><code>public class RunHeideltimeInJava {


public static void main(String[] args) throws
        DocumentCreationTimeMissingException, ParseException {

The sum of all bigrams that start with a particular word must be equal to the unigram count for that word?,"<p>In <a href=""https://lagunita.stanford.edu/c4x/Engineering/CS-224N/asset/slp4.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this</a> chapter (at the end of page 4) of a stanford book on natural language processing it says:</p>

  <p>The sum of all bigrams that start with a particular word must be equal to the unigram count for that word.</p>

<p>The book leaves why this is the case as an exercise to the reader but I don't understand why this would be true.<br />
For example in the following corpus:</p>

<ul>
<li>A ball is red.</li>
<li>All balls are red.</li>
</ul>

<p>As far as I understand the word red would occur twice in unigrams however not appear at all as the first element of a bi-gram?</p>

<p>Am I missing something like that the end of sentence is used as a token? (but then the problem reemerges for trigrams?)</p>

Why no programming in English? What is the difference between natural languages and programming languages?,"<p>What is the key difference between natural languages (such as English and French) and programming languages like C++ and Perl?</p>

<p>I am familiar with the ambiguity problem, but can't it be solved using an interactive compiler or using a subset of the natural language using a strict grammar but all the time still retaining the essence of the language?</p>

<p>Another issue is context. But lawyers have ways to solve this issue. (This question is not about reducing the programming complexity, it's simply about concise reasons and roadblock in using natural languages for instructing computer.)</p>

<p>Is there any other significant problem besides these two? Or do these two have greater consequences than I mentioned above? Is the interactive solution and lawyers language technically not feasible for programming?</p>

Best evaluation method for real-time machine translation?,"<p>I'm aware that there are many different methods like BLEU, NIST, METEOR etc. They all have their pros and cons, and their effectiveness differs from corpus to corpus. I'm interested in real-time translation, so that two people could have a conversation by typing out a couple sentences at a time and having it immediately translated.</p>

<p>What kind of corpus would this count as? Would the text be considered too short for proper evaluation by most conventional methods? Would the fact that the speaker is constantly switching make the context more difficult?</p>

How can I concatenate the lines of dialogue while doing Natural Language Processing on a book,"<p>I am working on a sentiment analysis project of a book. I am using nltk.vader.sentimentintensityanalyzer to record the sentiment polarity of paragraphs in the Harry Potter series. </p>

text = str(text_file.readlines())   
text.replace('\\n""', """").replace(""\'"", """").replace("" , "","""")

What is Word Injection in Context of Natural Language Processing and Whats are its Applications?,"<p>Hello All Community Members,</p>

<p>After going through various articles and blogs, I came to understand that suppose, in a corpus (<code>C1</code>), let's assume there exists a word (<code>w</code>). Now that same word (<code>w</code>) also appears in another related corpus (<code>C2</code>). Similarly, there exists <code>n</code> number of words in corpus. </p>

<p>By <strong>word injection</strong>, what I understand is that :- the word (<code>w</code>) in Corpus (C1) is replaced by its modified version (<code>.w</code>) with the assignment of some special character like (<code>.</code>, <code>_</code> or <code>$</code>) in corpus (<code>C2.</code>).</p>

<p><strong>Note:</strong> The modified version of word (<code>.w</code>) does not belong to the corpus C1 and C2. The word <code>.w</code> is the same word as <code>w</code> used in other context.</p>

<p>IS THIS THE CORRECT EXPLANATION for WORD INJECTION in NLP?</p>

<p>For example, the word <code>system</code> is replaced by <code>_system</code>. </p>

<p>I hope this is correct definition of word injection. Does there exist any way in python to achieve the above mentioned concept?</p>

<p>Any help is appreciated. </p>

Checking if word segmentation is possible,"<p>This is a follow up question to <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/3466972/how-to-split-a-string-into-words-ex-stringintowords-string-into-words/3469228#3469228"">this response</a> and the pseudo-code algorithm that the user posted. I didn't comment on that question because of its age. I am only interested in validating whether or not a string can be split into words. The algorithm doesn't need to actually split the string. This is the response from the linked question:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Let S[1..length(w)] be a table with Boolean entries. S[i] is true if
  the word w[1..i] can be split. Then set S[1] = isWord(w[1]) and for
  i=2 to length(w) calculate</p>
  
  <p>S[i] = (isWord[w[1..i] or for any j in {2..i}: S[j-1] and
  isWord[j..i]).</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I'm translating this algorithm into simple python code, but I'm not sure if I'm understanding it properly. Code:</p>

<pre><code>def is_all_words(a_string, dictionary)):
    str_len = len(a_string)
    S = [False] * str_len
    S[0] = is_word(a_string[0], dictionary)
    for i in range(1, str_len):
        check = is_word(a_string[0:i], dictionary)
        if (check):
            S[i] = check
        else:
            for j in range(1, str_len):
                check = (S[j - 1] and is_word(a_string[j:i]), dictionary)
                if (check):
                    S[i] == True
                    break
    return S
</code></pre>

<p>I have two related questions. 1) Is this code a proper translation of the linked algorithm into Python, and if it is, 2) Now that I have S, how do I use it to tell if the string <em>is</em> only comprised of words? In this case, <code>is_word</code> is a function that simply looks a given word up in a list. I haven't implemented it as a trie yet. </p>

<p>UPDATE: After updating the code to include the suggested change, it doesn't work. This is the updated code:</p>

<pre><code>def is_all_words(a_string, dictionary)):
    str_len = len(a_string)
    S = [False] * str_len
    S[0] = is_word(a_string[0], dictionary)
    for i in range(1, str_len):
        check = is_word(a_string[0:i], dictionary)
        if (check):
            S[i] = check
        else:
            for j in range(1, i): #THIS LINE WAS UPDATED
                check = (S[j - 1] and is_word(a_string[j:i]), dictionary)
                if (check):
                    S[i] == True
                    break
    return S

print(S[len(S) - 1]) #prints FALSE

Microsoft Azure Text Analytics Coginitive Service Encoding Issue,"<p>In order to use their text analytics, Azure requires a json file/document that looks like this:</p>

    {'id': '4', 'language': 'es', 'text': 'La carretera estaba atascada. Había mucho tráfico el día de ayer.'}]}
</code></pre>

<p>The issue I am getting at the moment is that the last record <code>id: 4</code> is causing this error:</p>

<pre><code>b'{""code"":""BadRequest"",""message"":""Invalid request"",""innerError"":{""code"":""InvalidRequestBodyFormat"",""message"":""Request body format is wrong. 
Make sure the json request is serialized correctly and there are no null members.""}}'

<p>The formatting of the JSON is correct, it's straight from their site and it runs perfectly fine without the last record. I tested some more and then found out that the <code>í</code> and <code>á</code> are the ones throwing the error. To make sure, I even tested it out with English words like resumé or fiancé but still the same error. But that doesn't make sense since Spanish is one of the supported languages for the text analysis and the text language is even define as Spanish before it's processed.</p>

<p>So my question is, am I missing something before passing my data through Azure? Am I suppose to convert, changing the encoding, or remove those characters or is this something that Azure's API should be able to handle?</p>

Getting the basic form of the english word,"<p>I am trying to get the basic english word for an english word which is modified from its base form. This question had been asked here, but I didnt see a proper answer, so I am trying to put it this way. I tried 2 stemmers and one lemmatizer from NLTK package which are porter stemmer, snowball stemmer, and wordnet lemmatiser.</p>

<p>I tried this code:</p>

<pre><code>from nltk.stem.porter import PorterStemmer
from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer

words = ['arrival','conclusion','ate']

for word in words:
    print ""\n\nOriginal Word =&gt;"", word
    print ""porter stemmer=&gt;"", PorterStemmer().stem(word)
    snowball_stemmer = SnowballStemmer(""english"")
    print ""snowball stemmer=&gt;"", snowball_stemmer.stem(word)
    print ""WordNet Lemmatizer=&gt;"", WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(word)

<pre><code>    Input : arrival
    Output: arrive

    Input : conclusion
    Output: conclude

    Input : ate
    Output: eat 
</code></pre>

<p>How can I achieve this? Are there any tools already available for this? This is called as morphological analysis. I am aware of that, but there must be some tools which are already achieving this. Help is appreciated :)</p>

<p><strong>First Edit</strong></p>

<p>I tried this code</p>

<pre><code>import nltk
from nltk.stem.wordnet import WordNetLemmatizer
from nltk.tokenize import word_tokenize
from nltk.corpus import wordnet as wn

query = ""The Indian economy is the worlds tenth largest by nominal GDP and third largest by purchasing power parity""

    wn_tag = penn_to_wn(tag[1])
    print tag[0]+""---&gt; ""+WordNetLemmatizer().lemmatize(tag[0],wn_tag)

How to Convert English to Cron?,"<p>I did some searching but haven't landed anything that looks useful yet but I am wondering if anyone knows of something (tool,lib etc) that can parse English phrases and translate them into a cron string.</p>

<p>It seems like something that would have lots of gotchas and it would be preferable to benefit from someone elses work. You see it in a few nice sites/apps that can work out what you mean from a simple phrase rather than having some hideous user interface.</p>

German stemmer is not removing feminine suffixes &quot;-in&quot; and &quot;-innen&quot;,"<p>In German, every job has a feminine and a masculine version. The feminine one is derived from the masculine one by adding an ""-in"" suffix. In the plural form, this turns into ""-innen"".</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>      | English          | German
------+------------------+-----------------------
masc. | teacher  doctor  | Lehrer      Arzt
fem.  | teacher  doctor  | Lehrerin    Ärztin
masc. | teachers doctors | Lehrer      Ärzte
fem.  | teachers doctors | Lehrerinnen Ärztinnen
</code></pre>

<p>Currently, I'm using NLTK's <code>nltk.stem.snowball.GermanStemmer</code>. 
It returns these stems:</p>

<pre><code>Lehrer      -&gt; lehr      | Arzt      -&gt; arzt
Lehrerin    -&gt; lehrerin  | Ärztin    -&gt; arztin
Lehrer      -&gt; lehr      | Ärzte     -&gt; arzt
Lehrerinnen -&gt; lehrerinn | Ärztinnen -&gt; arztinn
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a way to make this stemmer return the same stems for all four versions, feminine and masculine ones? Alternatively, is there any other stemmer doing that?</p>

<h2>Update</h2>

<p>I ended up adding ""-innen"" and ""-in"" as the first entries in the step 1 suffix-tuple like so:</p>

<pre><code>stemmer = GermanStemmer()
stemmer._GermanStemmer__step1_suffixes = (""innen"", ""in"") + stemmer._GermanStemmer__step1_suffixes
</code></pre>

<p>This way all of the above words are stemmed to <code>lehr</code> and <code>arzt</code> respectively. Also, all other ""job-forms"" that I tried so far are stemmed correctly, meaning masculine and feminine forms have the same stem. Also, if the ""job-form"" is derived from a verb, like <code>Lehrer/in</code>, they have the same stem as the verb.</p>

NLP algorithm to extract part of sentence in language translation,"<p>I am trying to solve a problem but am not able to find a way other than training the data sets and making a classifier.</p>

<p><strong>Problem:</strong></p>

<p>The user says to translate a particular sentence from one language to another. I have the user speech in text part, and need to extract these 3 things from the text:</p>

<ul>
<li>Sentence to be translated.</li>
<li>The language in which its supposed to be translated.</li>
<li>The origin language.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, when we humans say, its usually in the form of these examples:</p>

<ul>
<li>What is I love you in French from English?</li>
<li>Can you translate I love you from English to French?</li>
<li>What is French for I love you in English? </li>
</ul>

<p>And any other possible way that a person can ask for translation.</p>

<p>I need to extract <code>I love you</code>, <code>French</code> (the language translated into) and <code>English</code> (the language translated from) from the sentence.
The first thing that came to my mind was to use <code>Regular Expessions</code>. But I found that it can only be used to detect the language and not the sentence part to be translated.</p>

<p>The other possible solution seems to have the various form of sentence as training data set and train a classifier, but I still feel that this NLP problem can be solved using some algorithm but am not able to get anything. </p>

<p>This seems to be a popular problem, so is there any way it can be done?</p>

fastText and word2vec: NaNs in accuracy computation code,"<p>I downloaded the pre-trained English Wikipedia vectors file (<code>wiki.en.vec</code>) from the fastText Github repository page, and I tried to compute the syntactic and semantic analogy task accuracies as described in the first of Mikolov's word2vec papers as follows:</p>

<p>I built the word2vec repository by simply doing <code>make</code>.</p>

<p>I ran <code>./compute-accuracy wiki.en.vec 0 &lt; questions-words.txt</code>, i.e., I pass the pre-trained vectors file to the compute-accuracy binary from word2vec along with a threshold of 0 in order to consider the entire vocabulary instead of by default restricting it to 30000, and I also send in the accuracy computation dataset <code>questions-words.txt</code> using <code>&lt;</code> because I noticed that the code reads the dataset from stdin.</p>

<p>In response, I simply get a bunch of NaNs like below. This doesn't change even if I change the threshold value to 30000 or anything else.</p>

<pre><code>&gt;capital-common-countries:
ACCURACY TOP1: 0.00 % (0 / 1)
Total accuracy: -nan % Semantic accuracy: -nan % Syntactic accuracy: -nan %
</code></pre>

<p>Can someone please explain why the English pre-trained vectors don't seem to work with word2vec's accuracy computation code? I took a look at <code>compute-accuracy.c</code> and it does look like it expects standard vector file formatting convention and I took a look at <code>wiki.en.vec</code> as well, and it does look like it is formatted in standard convention.</p>

<p>Also, in the fastText paper, word analogy accuracies with fastText vectors are presented and the paper cites Mikolov's word2vec paper there -- clearly, the same dataset was used, and presumably the same word2vec <code>compute-accuracy.c</code> file was used to obtain the presented numbers. So could someone please explain what's going wrong?</p>

How to extract meaning of colloquial phrases and expressions in English,"<p>I am looking into extracting the meaning of expressions used in everyday speaking. For an instance, it is apparent to a human that the sentence <code>The meal we had at restaurant A tasted like food at my granny's.</code> means that the food was tasty. </p>

<p>How can I extract this meaning using a tool or a technique?</p>

<p>The method I've found so far is to first extract phrases using Stanford CoreNLP POS tagging, and use a Word Sense Induction tool to derive the meaning of the phrase. However, as WSI tools are used to get the meaning of words when they have multiple meanings, I am not sure if it would be the best tool to use. </p>

<p>What would be the best method to extract the meanings? Or is there any tool that can both identify phrases and extract their meanings? </p>

Fixing error output from seq2seq model,"<p>I want to ask you how we can effectively re-train a trained seq2seq model to remove/mitigate a specific observed error output. I'm going to give an example about Speech Synthesis, but any idea from different domains, such as Machine Translation and Speech Recognition, using seq2seq model will be appreciated.</p>

<p>I learned the basics of seq2seq with attention model, especially for Speech Synthesis such as <a href=""https://github.com/Rayhane-mamah/Tacotron-2"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Tacotron-2</a>.
Using a distributed well-trained model showed me how naturally our computer could speak with the seq2seq (end-to-end) model (you can listen to some audio samples <a href=""https://r9y9.github.io/blog/2018/05/20/tacotron2/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>). But still, the model fails to read some words properly, e.g., it fails to read ""obey [əˈbā]"" in multiple ways like [əˈbī] and [əˈbē].</p>

<p>The reason is obvious because the word ""obey"" appears too little, only three times out of 225,715 words, in our dataset (<a href=""https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">LJ Speech</a>), and the model had no luck.</p>

<p>So, how can we re-train the model to overcome the error? Adding extra audio clips containing the ""obey"" pronunciation sounds impractical, but reusing the three audio clips has the danger of overfitting. And also, I suppose we use a well-trained model and ""simply training more"" is not an effective solution.</p>

<p>Now, this is one of the drawbacks of seq2seq model, which is not talked much. The model successfully simplified the pipelines of the traditional models, e.g., for Speech Synthesis, it replaced an acoustic model and a text analysis frontend etc by a single neural network. But we lost the controllability of our model at all. It's impossible to make the system read in a specific way.</p>

<p>Again, if you use a seq2seq model in any field and get an undesirable output, how do you fix that? Is there a data-scientific workaround to this problem, or maybe a cutting-edge Neural Network mechanism to gain more controllability in seq2seq model?</p>

<p>Thanks.</p>

<p>I'm working on some natural language processing and am trying to check if a word in one list is in another using the %in% check. Problem is, it returns everything as FALSE when I know there should be at least a few TRUE returns. I'm wondering if the issue is with the type of objects I am working with? Though when I run tests everything is a character object so I thought this shouldn't be an issue. Here is my code: </p>

<pre><code>library(dplyr)
library(tokenizers)
library(tidytext)

biggie &lt;- read.csv(""C:/Users/My.Name/Desktop/biggie.csv"", stringsAsFactors=FALSE)

colnames(biggie)[1] &lt;- 'biggie'



bigsplit &lt;- biggie %&gt;% 
  unnest_tokens(word, biggie)

pos &lt;- read.csv(""C:/Users/My.Name/Desktop/positive.csv"", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

positive &lt;- function(data){
  pos_count &lt;- 0
  for(i in 1:nrow(data)){

      pos_count = pos_count + 1
    }
  }
  return(pos_count/nrow(data)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Here I found a workaround, but I feel like it adds unnecessary loops/steps into the function and takes a lot more computing power than I would like it to: </p>

<pre><code>#Tests
bigsplit[1,1] = ""abound""
bigsplit[1,1] %in% pos #Returns FALSE, but I would expect TRUE

  pos_count = 0

Finding path in a matrix for sentence alignment,"<p>Following problem: I am working with python and I have two texts in different languages (texta and textb) which have both a lot of sentences. The aim is to align each sentence in texta with a sentence of textb. The overall length is roughly equal, but the number of the sentences is not. It is somewhere about 1:1.3, so at times one sentence of texta might get two sentences of textb. The order of the sentences in both texts needs to be preserved. 
Now I have a CNN that outputs a matrix of all the sentences and a propability score of them being a translation of each other. 
This might in a simplified way look like this:</p>

<pre><code>[0.5,0.2,.0.0]
[0.1,0.6,0.4]
[0.2,0.3,0.8]
</code></pre>

<p>The accuracy of these predictions is about 50%. So when I just select the best result of each row I get a precision of 50%. 
Now one would expect the ideal path to be more or less diagonal, since both texts will contain more or less the same information at the same place. However in reality this is not always the case. A sentence can be short, a sentence can be long, sometimes a paragraph is missing (translation mistake). So I wonder what is a nice approach to solve this problem. My first idea is to just measure the distance to the diagonal center and give a penalty that reduces the propability score as further as an element is away from that center. However this approach is weak in the case that a paragraph is missing and thus a longer sequence of sentences lies further away from the center. So I am looking for a kind of optimization technique, but I do not know where to start yet.</p>

Is there a programming language with semantics close to English?,"<p>Most languages allow to 'tweek' to certain extend parts of the syntax (<a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/829125/c-loop-macros"">C++</a>,<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/aa664765(v=vs.71).aspx"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">C#</a>) and/or semantics that you will be using in your code (<a href=""http://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=1945282"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Katahdin</a>, <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lua_(programming_language)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">lua</a>). But I have not heard of a language that can just completely define how your code will look like. So  isn't there some language which already exists that has such capabilities to override <strong>all</strong> syntax &amp; define semantics ? </p>

<p>Example of what I want to do is basically from the C# code below:</p>

<pre><code>foreach(Fruit fruit in Fruits)
{
  if(fruit is Apple)
  {
    fruit.Price =  fruit.Price/2;
  }
}
</code></pre>

<p>I want do be able to to write the above code in my perfect language like this:</p>

<pre><code>Check if any fruits are Macintosh apples and discount the price by 50%.
</code></pre>

<p>The advantages that come to my mind looking from a coder's perspective in this ""imaginary"" language are:</p>

<ol>
<li>It's very clear what is going on (self descriptive) - it's plain English after all even kid would understand my program</li>
<li>Hides all complexities which I have to write in C#. But why should I care to learn that
if statements, arithmetic operators etc since there are already implemented</li>
</ol>

<p>The disadvantages that I see for a coder who will maintain this program are:</p>

<ol>
<li>Maybe you would express  this program differently from me so you may not get all the
information that I've expressed in my sentence</li>
<li>Programs can be quite verbose and hard to debug but  if possible to even proximate this type of syntax above maybe more people would start programming right? That would be amazing I think. I can go to work and just write an essay to draw a square on a winform like this: </li>
</ol>

<p><code>Create a form called MyGreetingForm. Draw a square with in the middle of 
MyGreetingFormwith a side of 100 points. In the middle of the square write ""Hello! Click here to continue"" in Arial font.</code></p>

<p>In the above code the parser must basically guess that I want to use
    the unnamed square from the previous sentence, it'd be hard to write such a smart parser I guess, yet it's so simple what I want to do.</p>

<p><code>If the user clicks on square in the middle of MyGreetingForm show MyMainForm.</code>  </p>

<p>In the above code 'basically' the compiler must: 1)generate an event handler 2) check if there is any square in the middle of the form and if there is - 3) hide the form and show another form  </p>

<p>It looks very hard to do but it doesn't look impossible IMO to me at least approximate this (I can personally generate a parser to perform the 3 steps above np &amp; it's basically the same that it has to do any way when you add even in c# <code>a.MyEvent=+handler;</code> so I don't see a problem here) so I'm thinking maybe somebody already did something like this ? Or is there some practical burden of complexity to create such a 'essay style' programming language which I can't see ? I mean what's the worse that can happen if the parser is not that good? - your program will crash so you have to re-word it:)</p>

Where can I find a list of english part of speech constraints?,"<p>I'm looking for a list of English part of speech sequencing rules (e.g. ""a determiner cannot be followed by a verb"").

Is natural language Turing complete?,"<p>I'm pretty sure a human language (e.g. English) is powerful enough to simulate a Turing machine, which would make it Turing complete. However, that would imply natural languages are no more or less expressive than programming languages, which seems questionable.</p>

<p>Here's my experience with BreakIterator:</p>

<p>Using the example <a href=""http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/i18n/text/examples/BreakIteratorDemo.java"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a>:
I have the following Japanese:</p>

<pre><code>今日はパソコンを買った。高性能のマックは早い！とても快適です。
</code></pre>

<p>In ascii, it looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>\ufeff\u4eca\u65e5\u306f\u30d1\u30bd\u30b3\u30f3\u3092\u8cb7\u3063\u305f\u3002\u9ad8\u6027\u80fd\u306e\u30de\u30c3\u30af\u306f\u65e9\u3044\uff01\u3068\u3066\u3082\u5feb\u9069\u3067\u3059\u3002
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the part of that sample that I changed:
  static void sentenceExamples() {</p>

<pre><code>  Locale currentLocale = new Locale (""ja"",""JP"");
  BreakIterator sentenceIterator = 
     BreakIterator.getSentenceInstance(currentLocale);
  String someText = ""今日はパソコンを買った。高性能のマックは早い！とても快適です。"";
</code></pre>

<p>When I look at the Boundary indices, I see this:</p>

<pre><code>0|13|24|32
</code></pre>

<p>But those indices don't correspond to any sentence terminators.</p>

Splitting a string by text language,"<p>I am working with a corpus of text documents (stored as one character string each) that are predominantly in English, but include some documents in Spanish and some that repeat the same information in both English and Spanish. I used the <code>cld2</code> and <code>cld3</code> packages (which implement Chrome's language detection functionality in R) to estimate the languages contained in each string in the corpus. My goal is to process all the strings containing text in both English and Spanish such that the English portions are retained and the Spanish portions are removed.</p>

<p>Here is an example of three of the strings I'm working with:</p>

<p>As far as I've been able to determine, <code>cld2</code> and <code>cld3</code> can estimate the languages contained within a string, but cannot extract portions of the string based on language.</p>

<p>Is there a different package in R that I can use to identify the portions of each string that are in each language, and split the string in two based on that?</p>

Should I create a higher-level regular expression language to express common patterns?,"<p>I'm using regular expressions to find certain patterns in natural language processing.</p>

<p>I find myself using the same patterns over and over. and since these patterns can be hard to read in a terse regular expression, I'm asking myself if I should develop a higher order regular language that captures that?</p>

<p>will I be digging myself into a hole trying to define a DSL like that?
what's a good framework for developing such a language, and what can I expect in terms of effort of building it?
what are some common pitfalls for defining and building such a language?</p>

<p>it could look something like this
[views] overlooking [the] ($object)</p>

<p>that would capture text such as ""overlooking the ocean"" or ""overlooking cityscapes"". </p>

Chat-Bot sentence parsing methods,"<p>I have created a WhatsApp chat-bot using 'Selenium' and 'BeautifulSoup' in <em>Python</em>. I parse the incoming messages using Regex by matching it with pre defined data-sets.</p>

How does language detection work?,"<p>I have been wondering for some time how does Google translate(or maybe a hypothetical translator) detect language from the string entered in the ""from"" field. I have been thinking about this and only thing I can think of is looking for words that are unique to a language in the input string. The other way could be to check sentence formation or other semantics in addition to keywords. But this seems to be a very difficult task considering different languages and their semantics. I did some research to find that there are ways that use n-gram sequences and use some statistical models to detect language. Would appreciate a high level answer too.</p>

Translation to Predicate Logic (PL) with lexicon,"<p>I have the following statement that I would like to translate to predicate logic:</p>

"In natural language processing (NLP), how do you make an efficient dimension reduction?","<p>In NLP, it's always the case that the dimension of the features are very huge. For example, for one project at hand, the dimension of features  is almost 20 thousands (p = 20,000), and each feature is a 0-1 integer to show whether a specific word or bi-gram is presented in a paper (one  paper is a data point $x \in R^{p}$).</p>

<p>I know the redundancy among the features is huge, so dimension reduction is necessary. I have three questions:</p>

<p>1) I have 10 thousands data points (n = 10,000), and each data points has 10 thousands features (p = 10,000). What is the effieient  way to conduct dimension reduction? The matrix $X \in R^{n \times p}$ is so huge that both PCA (or SVD, truncated SVD is OK, but I don't think SVD is a good way to reduce dimention for binary features) and Bag of Words (or K-means) is hard be be directly conducted on $X$ (Sure, it is sparse). I don't have a server, I just use my PC:-(.</p>

<p>2) How to judge the similarity or distance among two data points? I think the Euclidean distance may not work well for binary features. How about L0 norm? What do you use?</p>

<p>3) If I want to use SVM machine (or other kernel methods) to conduct classification, which kernel should I use?</p>

<p>Many Thanks!</p>

  <p>žvakan    žvakati Appmsvn 0   0.000000</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The format meaning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[inflected word]  [lemma form] [grammatical context]  ... and tf-idf info that I don't use</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, in typical scenario I have to match ~5000 of various [inflected word]s to retrieve [lemma form]s and more importantly: [grammatical context]s, where single [inflected word] may actually have more matching lines (like in the case of <strong>žvakan</strong>). The lexical resource to search has about 7 milion lines.</p>

<p>So far, I tried with loading the complete file into List and then running all ~5000 Regexes against each line (List item) using Parallel.ForEach. Regex was used for flexibility to query via [lemma form] or using only part of the word, but for sake of performance I can give up on that. And it took something like 30 minutes to find about 350 entries. So, obviously my approach was completely wrong.</p>

<p>Now I'm thinking to load the complete file into Dictionary where the key would be [inflected word] (so I give up on flexibility) but I wonder:</p>

<ul>
<li>Would it make sense (for greater execution time) to nest two dictionaries like this:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dictionary&lt;[first letter], Dictionary&lt;[inflected word], List&lt;[definition
     line]>>></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Would it do any better then loading all into:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Dictionary&lt;[inflected word], List&lt;[definition line]>></p>
</blockquote>

<ul>
<li>Is there some better idea?</li>
</ul>

<p>I'm not using ConcurrentDictionary since the content is written into data structure only once, before the use starts. </p>

<p>My preference is solely query execution time - RAM seems not to be an issue - with current code I have 19Gb of RAM available, and I have 8 core CPU so any comments on Parallel execution are also welcome. </p>

<p>I know that this is impossible (is it?) but I think that this can be interesting.</p>

"sequence to sequence learning for language translation, what about unseen words","<p>sequence to sequence learning is a powerful mechanism for language translation, especially using it locally in a context specific case.</p>

<p>I am following <a href=""http://pytorch.org/tutorials/intermediate/seq2seq_translation_tutorial.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">this <code>pytorch</code> tutorial</a> for the task.</p>

<p>However, the tutorial did not split the data into training and testing.
You might think its not a big deal, just split it up, use one chunk for training and the other for testing. But it is not that simple.</p>

<p>Essentially, the tutorial creates the indices of the seen words while leading the dataset. The indices are simply stored in the dictionary. This is before going to the encoder RNN, just a simple conversion kind of task from words to the numbers.</p>

<p>If data is split up at random, what happens is, one of the keyword may not appear in the sentences from the training set, and so may not have an index at all. If it shows up at the time of testing, what should be done?</p>

<p>Extend the dictionary? </p>

Approaches to improve Microsoft ChatBot with each user conversation by learning from it?,"<p>I am building a Microsoft ChatBot using LUIS for natural language processing. I would like LUIS to improve by learning new utterences for the intents identified. </p>

<p>For example, if my 'Greeting' intent has utterences 'Hi', 'Hello', 'Hello, how are you?', the next time it encounters 'How are you?', it may predict the intent as 'Greeting' with a low accuracy. If that utterance is learnt as part of the intent, then in future, this utterence will be predicted with better accuracy and also help us in recognizing utterences closer to this utterence.</p>

<p>The learning could be based on:</p>

<blockquote>
  <ol>
  <li>All input for which intent was identified. (I understand this can cause wrong learnings).</li>
  <li>Inputs identified by LUIS and verified by user or agent real-time or later offline.</li>
  <li>Inputs identified right/wrong but verified and corrected by the agent or  support team later via an easier UI.</li>
  </ol>
</blockquote>

<p>I understand LUIS gives a 'Suggested Utterences' tab which takes care of point 3. I am trying to understand how we can automate this learning by minimal user intervention. </p>

<p>What are the various approaches used in projects?</p>

How to disambiguate words in Conceptnet,"<p><a href=""http://conceptnet5.media.mit.edu/"" rel=""nofollow"">Conceptnet</a> contains two basic types of nodes, words (e.g. /c/en/cat) and senses (e.g. /c/en/cat/n/domestic_cat). Unfortunately, the vast majority of edges use word nodes. This makes inferring difficult, because I can't be sure which sense a word-to-word edge is referring to. </p>

<p>For example, Conceptnet contains 9 senses that use the word ""cat"", most being proper nouns (/c/en/cat/n/musical, /c/en/cat/n/magazine, /c/en/cat/n/a_spiteful_woman_gossip, etc). If an edge says ""/c/en/cat /r/HasA /c/en/tail"", I know by using my own experience that that's probably referring to /c/en/cat/n/domestic_cat and no other senses. Whereas if I see an edge that says ""/c/en/cat /r/IsA /c/en/fun_to_watch"", I know it's probably referring to /c/en/cat/n/musical, but it also still might be referring to /c/en/cat/n/domestic_cat.</p>

<p>Also it seems really hard to search for, as I do not really know how to formulate the question.</p>

<p>What direction should I be looking in? Is there a science or even a service that I could leverage?</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

Which natural languages are supported by Google Cloud Natural Language API?,"<p>I can't find this crucial information in the official docs or here.
Which natural languages are supported by the service? Which languages will be supported in the near future?
I'm interested in POS tagging with lemmatization and dependency parsing. I tried analysing Russian, Polish and even Italian sentences and got a 400s (“The language ru is not supported for syntax analysis” etc.).
If advertising a service as multilingual, it would be fair to admit which languages are supported before having to register and enter credit card details.</p>

Natural Language Processing of Topics,"<p>I'm a part of a group working on a big data course project and we've run into what we see as a problem for NLP. Currently we have groups of data formatted in JSON as such:</p>

<pre><code>    ""wine"": {
        ""category"": ""socializing"",
        ""category_id"": 31,
        ""score"": 0.0,
        ""topic_id"": 611
    }
    ""dragons"": {
        ""category"": ""lifestyle"",
        ""category_id"": 17,
        ""score"": 0.279108277990115,
        ""topic_id"": 2137
    },
    ""furry-fandom"": {
        ""category"": ""lifestyle"",
        ""category_id"": 17,
        ""score"": 0.279108277990115,

        ""score"": 0.279108277990115,
        ""topic_id"": 10523
    }
</code></pre>

<p>The tags are topics associated with relevant info (a category, popularity score, and a category/topic ID #). We have associated categories for each topic already since the API we're pulling from handles it. Our problem though is that the categories are too broad, with only 33, for identifying any meaningful trends and the topics are too specific w/overlap (e.g. dragons/legendarycreatures) and there are too many with approx 22,000.</p>

<p>This is where NLP comes in; we want to create some sort of set of super-topics that aren't as broad as ""category"" but not as specific as the current topics. An example using ""dragons"" and ""legandarycreatures"" again would be both, along with others, fitting into a super-topic of ""fantasy"".</p>

<p>A little more background, we're using Python to grab/process our data, we'd like to continue to use it for this, and none of us have any practical experience with NLP. </p>

<p>With this all in mind, we'd love to have some suggestions and help with this area of struggle. If there are better ways or maybe it isn't feasible with NLP, we are open to them. What we're trying to avoid though is hard coding some sort of table for categorization.</p>

<p>TL;DR: We're trying to categorize a set of 22,000 topics to appropriate ""super-topics"" that are more specific than the current ones but less broad than the current categories. We're trying to do this with NLP while using Python but don't know how to go about it and are open to suggestions as well.</p>

How to tune a Machine Translation model with huge language model?,"<p><code>Moses</code> is a software to build machine translation models. And <code>KenLM</code> is the defacto language model software that moses uses.</p>

<p>I have a textfile with 16GB of text and i use it to build a language model as such:</p>

<pre><code>bin/lmplz -o 5 &lt;text &gt; text.arpa
</code></pre>

<p>The resulting file (<code>text.arpa</code>) is 38GB. Then I binarized the language model as such:</p>

<pre><code>bin/build_binary text.arpa text.binary
</code></pre>

<p>And the binarized language model (<code>text.binary</code>) grows to 71GB.</p>

<p>In <code>moses</code>, after training the translation model, you should tune the weights of the model by using <code>MERT</code> algorithm. And this can simply be done with <a href=""https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/training/mert-moses.pl"">https://github.com/moses-smt/mosesdecoder/blob/master/scripts/training/mert-moses.pl</a>. </p>

<p>MERT works fine with small language model but with the big language model, it takes quite some days to finish. </p>

<p>I did a google search and found KenLM's filter, which promises to filter the language model to a smaller size: <a href=""https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/filter/"">https://kheafield.com/code/kenlm/filter/</a></p>

<p>But i'm clueless as to how to make it work. The command help gives:</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/moses/bin/filter
Usage: /home/alvas/moses/bin/filter mode [context] [phrase] [raw|arpa] [threads:m] [batch_size:m] (vocab|model):input_file output_file

copy mode just copies, but makes the format nicer for e.g. irstlm's broken
    parser.
single mode treats the entire input as a single sentence.
multiple mode filters to multiple sentences in parallel.  Each sentence is on
    a separate line.  A separate file is created for each sentence by appending
    the 0-indexed line number to the output file name.
union mode produces one filtered model that is the union of models created by
    multiple mode.

context means only the context (all but last word) has to pass the filter, but
    the entire n-gram is output.

phrase means that the vocabulary is actually tab-delimited phrases and that the
    phrases can generate the n-gram when assembled in arbitrary order and
    clipped.  Currently works with multiple or union mode.

The file format is set by [raw|arpa] with default arpa:
raw means space-separated tokens, optionally followed by a tab and arbitrary
    text.  This is useful for ngram count files.
arpa means the ARPA file format for n-gram language models.

threads:m sets m threads (default: conccurrency detected by boost)
batch_size:m sets the batch size for threading.  Expect memory usage from this
    of 2*threads*batch_size n-grams.

There are two inputs: vocabulary and model.  Either may be given as a file
    while the other is on stdin.  Specify the type given as a file using
    vocab: or model: before the file name.  

For ARPA format, the output must be seekable.  For raw format, it can be a
    stream i.e. /dev/stdout

<p>But when I tried the following, it gets stuck and does nothing:</p>

<pre><code>$ ~/moses/bin/filter union lm.en.binary lm.filter.binary

Using NLP to Extract Information from check-ins and Comments,"<p>We're CS students and we're working on a recommendation system for our GP. 
Our data set contains users and the places they have visited, we want to use NLP to translate those places into activities.

Implementing linguistic rules to transliterate Thai words,"<p>I can't find any open code in order to transliterate Thai script to a phonetic equivalent.
For example:
<code>สวัสดี</code> which can be transliterated to <code>sà-wàt-di</code>
It's like pinyin for Chinese. This enables learners of a foreign script to get the proper pronunciation even if one can't read the script.</p>

<p>There is a defined standard by ISO, which isn't usable since it's an exact transliteration, char by char. But Thai uses chars in front above and after other chars.</p>

<p>There are websites and software that can do transliteration automatically, so it's possible to do this automatically. Nonetheless there's no open code available and I searched in English as well as Thai language. There are some research papers on that but always without logic or code, describing that topic in a high-level fashion. </p>

<p>My approach so far:
I define the phonemes that are possible in the Thai language and transcribe them to English:</p>

<p>We have some simple letters that always make the same sound:</p>

<pre><code>/*
x - consonants:
ก   -&gt;  g
ข   -&gt;  kh
ค   -&gt;  kh
ฆ   -&gt;  kh
ง   -&gt;  ng

ฉ   -&gt;  dsch
ช   -&gt;  dsch

<p>I am not sure what approach would be short enough to contain all of those rules, without retyping a lot of if/else or switch/cases. Furthermore a syllable string can contain an optional character: a tone mark. This is not always the case but often. So my approach would be, to first strip the vowel string from the tone mark and then process some rule like:</p>

<pre><code>// example เดียว -&gt;     diau
string vowel001 = ""iau"";

string thaiword = ""เดียว"";
if( thaiword.substring(0,1)==""เ"" &amp;&amp;
    thaiword.substring(1,2)==""ี"" &amp;&amp; /*the unicode character moves above "" which we don't have to care about*/
    thaiword.substring(2,3)==""ย"" &amp;&amp; 
    thaiword.substring(3,4)==""ว""){
    return getConsonantTransliteration(string.pos.1) + vowel001;
}
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a faster and more oop approach to do that, instead of writing such a rule for every possibility?</p>

<p>Edit2:</p>

<p>Currently the fastest way seems to be a Regular Expression approach:</p>

<p>Given the example <code>เอียว</code> vowel and all it's possible variations:</p>

<pre><code>เลียว
เลี้ยว
เหลียว
เหลี้ยว
เหี้ยว

find:       เ(ห{0,1})([ก-ฮ])ี([่้๊๋]{0,1})ยว
replace:    silenth[\1] initialcons[\2] tone[\3]

เลียว --&gt;   silenth[] initialcons[ล] tone[]
เลี้ยว --&gt;  silenth[] initialcons[ล] tone[้]
เหลียว --&gt;  silenth[ห] initialcons[ล] tone[]

Swedish NLP for product search engine with structured data,"<p>I’m currently working on a project in which I have a database with 1000 products (washing machines), where each one has 21 product attributes (such as weight, dimensions, colour, power consumption and so on.)
My aim to use NLP to make the users able to search the database of products by queries of natural language, like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Find a washing machine that can load at least 8 kg of laundry, and with height no more than 60 cm and with a front of stainless steel”</p>
<p>“I’m looking for a washing machine that costs less than 6000 SEK and has the opening in the front, not in the top”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This NL query needs to be translated to a SQL-query to be used with my database. The problem is that I would need it to work in the Swedish language.
I’ve found a great API (<a href=""https://json-tagger.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://json-tagger.com/</a>) that does the pre-processing of the sentences for me, tokenization and tagging Part of speech in Swedish. Thanks! But now I would really like some tips on how I best use this to translate it to SQL-queries?</p>

"Independent clause boundary disambiguation, and independent clause segmentation – any tools to do this?","<p>I remember skimming the sentence segmentation section from the NLTK site a long time ago. </p>

<p>I use a crude text replacement of “period” “space” with “period” “manual line break” to achieve sentence segmentation, such as with a Microsoft Word replacement (<code>.</code> -> <code>.^p</code>) or a Chrome extension:</p>

<p><a href=""https://github.com/AhmadHassanAwan/Sentence-Segmentation"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/AhmadHassanAwan/Sentence-Segmentation</a></p>

<p><a href=""https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sentence-segmenter/jfbhkblbhhigbgdnijncccdndhbflcha"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/sentence-segmenter/jfbhkblbhhigbgdnijncccdndhbflcha</a></p>

<p>This is instead of an NLP method like the Punkt tokenizer of NLTK. </p>

<p>I segment to help me more easily locate and reread sentences, which can sometimes help with reading comprehension. </p>

<p>What about independent clause boundary disambiguation, and independent clause segmentation? Are there any tools that attempt to do this?</p>

<p>Below is some example text. If an independent clause can be identified within a sentence, there’s a split. Starting from the end of a sentence, it moves left, and greedily splits:</p>

<p>E.g.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>Sentence</strong> boundary disambiguation
  (SBD), also known as sentence
  breaking, is the problem in natural
  language processing of deciding where </p>
  
  <p>sentences begin and end. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Often</strong>, natural language processing
  tools </p>
  
  <p>require their input to be divided into
  sentences for a number of reasons. </p>
  
  <p><strong>However</strong>, sentence boundary
  identification is challenging because punctuation </p>
  
  <p>marks are often ambiguous.</p>
  
  <p><strong>For</strong> example, a period may </p>
  
  <p>denote an abbreviation, decimal point,
  an ellipsis, or an email address - not
  the end of a sentence. </p>
  
  <p><strong>About</strong> 47% of the periods in the Wall
  Street Journal corpus </p>
  
  <p>denote abbreviations.[1] </p>
  
  <p><strong>As</strong> well, question marks and
  exclamation marks may </p>
  
  <p>appear in embedded quotations,
  emoticons, computer code, and slang.</p>
  
  <p><strong>Another</strong> approach is to automatically </p>
  
  <p>learn a set of rules from a set of
  documents where the sentence</p>
  
  <p>breaks are pre-marked. </p>
  
  <p><strong>Languages</strong> like Japanese and Chinese </p>
  
  <p>have unambiguous sentence-ending
  markers.</p>
  
  <p><strong>The</strong> standard 'vanilla' approach to </p>
  
  <p>locate the end of a sentence:</p>
  
  <p>(a) <strong>If</strong> </p>
  
  <p>it's a period,  </p>
  
  <p>it ends a sentence.</p>
  
  <p>(b) <strong>If</strong> the preceding  </p>
  
  <p>token is on my hand-compiled list of
  abbreviations, then  </p>
  
  <p>it doesn't end a sentence.</p>
  
  <p>(c) <strong>If</strong> the next  </p>
  
  <p>token is capitalized, then  </p>
  
  <p>it ends a sentence.</p>
  
  <p><strong>This</strong> </p>
  
  <p>strategy gets about 95% of sentences
  correct.[2]</p>
  
  <p><strong>Solutions</strong> have been based on a maximum
  entropy model.[3] </p>
  
  <p><strong>The</strong> SATZ architecture uses a neural
  network to </p>
  
  <p>disambiguate sentence boundaries and
  achieves 98.5% accuracy.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(I’m not sure if I split it properly.)</p>

<p>If there are no means to segment independent clauses, are there any search terms that I can use to further explore this topic?</p>

Natural language processing. POS tagging and syntax analysis,"<p>I am currently working hard on implementing my own library for English language processing. The real challenge is to go through all abundance of theoretical material and get the quantum of understading how to put it all on rails of production.</p>

<p>I have made some progress so far. I implemented end-of-sentence detector and Early parser. But the fact is unless I include in my terminal dictionary the specific word the parser can not recognize it and build chart.</p>

<p>To be more explicit please review the following example of my CFGrammar:</p>

<pre><code>Production[] ppTerminals = { new Production(new Word[] { new Terminal(""Preposition""), new NonTerminal(""NP"") })};
AddProduction(ppTerminal, ""PP""); // Add production
...
DictionaryBuilder(Prepositions.SingleWord, ""Preposition""); //Where
Prepositions.SingleWord is a hard-coded list of possible prepositions.
</code></pre>

<p>As a result if Earley parser comes across, let's say, unknown two-word PP like ""up to"" it will fail to recognize it and build chart.</p>

<p>So I think I need something else prior to syntax parser that will handles my sentences and then forward relevant data to parser. The main idea is that the dictionary was built up dynamically at the stage of POS tagging, then Earley parser can recognize a word.</p>

<p>I implemented tokenizer and lexer. As an output I have got S-Expression tree like:</p>

<pre><code>(sentence
  (word BOND)
  (word TRADING)
  (word REVENUES)
  (word AT)
  (word GOLDMAN)
  (word SACHS)
  (word SLID)
  (value 40%)
  ...
  (word AND)
  (word CURRENCIES)
  (word WAS)
  (currency $1.16BN)
  ...
 )
</code></pre>

<p>But I'm familiar with Hidden Markov Model and such algorithms like the Viterbi algorithm for finding the most likely state sequence and the Baum-Welch algorithm for parameter estimation.</p>

<p>Could you please give me just a piece of advice how to link together Earley parser and POS tagging based on HMM. Or, propabably, I am going a wrong direction so then please point out where I run wrong.  Now I am a bit confused. Thank you!</p>

I already complied the list into two separate lists: the first list contains the root of the word that I would like the others to take on, while the second list is the variant forms that the item in the first list can take on. I've made it so that both lists correspond to each other. For example, <code>list_1[0]</code> would correspond to the words in <code>list_2[0]</code>. As a result, there are a lot of nested lists of different lengths within list_2. </p>

<p>My issue seems to arise when I'm searching through nested lists. I have to iterate through <code>text_token</code> to check if any of the words in <code>text_token</code> exist in <code>list_2</code>. If <code>text_token</code> exists in <code>list_2</code> then find <code>misc = list_2.index(word)</code> . After finding <code>misc</code>, I want to replace word with search <code>list_1[misc]</code>. However, after confirming that word exists in <code>list_2</code>, I try to <code>print(list_2.index(word))</code> to see if it works, but i keep receiving <code>ValueError: 'hh' is not in list</code> I'm not entirely sure how to cycle through nested lists after already having done so in order to avoid this error, because I'm assuming that when I search through the definitions a second time, it doesn't see the nested list as multiple items. I've tried to circumvent this by trying another list comprehension after checking it in the original one, but it ends up returning individual letters. I've also tried making these two lists into a dictionary, but I can't seem to figure out how to yield <code>.keys()</code> from <code>.values()</code>.</p>

rows csv into nested list,"<p>I'm a beginner in programming, but for a natural language processing project I need to work with csv. 
I have this csv file with annotated text. The sentences are separated from each other with an empty row. Each row is a token (word or punctuation with it's annotation). What I need is a nested list like this <code>[[[I,pronoun],[need, verb], [you, pronoun]], [[Do, verb], [you, pronoun], [need, verb], [me, pronoun]]]</code></p>

Why do we do padding in NLP tasks?,"<p>In NLP tasks, it's very common that people annotate a sentence with SOC (start of a sentence) and EOC(end of a sentence). Why do they do that? </p>

<p>Is it a task dependent performance? For instance, the reason you do padding in NER problems is different from the reason you do padding for translation problems? As in the NER problem you do padding as to extract more useful features from the context, however in a translation problem, you do padding to identify the end of a sentence because the decoder is trained sentence-by-sentence.</p>

Natural language processing keywords for building search engine,"<p>I'm recently interested in NLP, and would like to build up search engine for product recommendation. (Actually I'm always wondering about how search engine for Google/Amazon is built up)</p>

<p>Take Amazon product as example, where I could access all ""word"" information about one product:</p>

<pre><code>Product_Name    Description      ReviewText
""XXX brand""    ""Pain relief""    ""This is super effective""
</code></pre>

<p>By applying <code>nltk</code> and <code>gensim</code> packages I could easily compare similarity of different products and make recommendations.</p>

<p>But here's another question I feel very vague about:
How to build a search engine for such products? </p>

<p>For example, if I feel pain and would like to search for medicine online, I'd like to type-in <code>""pain relief""</code> or <code>""pain""</code>, whose searching results should include <code>""XXX brand""</code>.</p>

<p>So this sounds more like keyword extraction/tagging question? How should this be done in NLP? I know <strong>corpus</strong> should contain <strong>all</strong> but <strong>single</strong> words, so it's like:</p>

<pre><code>[""XXX brand"" : (""pain"", 1),(""relief"", 1)]
</code></pre>

<p>So if I typed in either <code>""pain""</code> or <code>""relief""</code> I could get <code>""XXX brand""</code>; but what about I searched <code>""pain relief""</code>?</p>

<p>I could come up with idea that directly call python in my javascript for calculate similarities of input words <code>""pain relief""</code> on browser-based server and make recommendation; but that's kind of do-able? </p>

<p>I still prefer to build up very big lists of keywords at backends, stored in datasets/database and directly visualized in web page of search engine.</p>

<p>Thanks!</p>

How to deactivate the default stop words feature for sklearn TfidfVectorizer,"<p>I am trying to get the tf-idf values for Japanese words.
The problem I am having is that sklearn TfidfVectorizer removes some Japanese characters, which I want to keep, as stop words. </p>

<p>The following is the example:</p>

<pre><code>from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
tf = TfidfVectorizer(stop_words = None)

words_list = [""歯"",""が"",""痛い""]
tfidf_matrix =  tf.fit_transform(words_list)
feature_names = tf.get_feature_names() 
print (feature_names)
</code></pre>

<p>The output is:<code>['痛い']</code></p>

<p>However, I want to keep all those three characters in the list.
I believe TfidfVectorizer removes characters with length of 1 as stop words.
How could I deactivate the default stop words feature and keep all characters?</p>

Identify a list of items using Natural Language Processing,"<p>Is there a way for NLP parsers to identify a list? <br>
For example, <em>""a tiger, a lion and a gorilla""</em> should be identified as a list<br>
(I don't need it to be identified as a list of animals; just a list would be sufficient).</p>

<p>My ultimate aim is to link a common verb/word to all the items in the list.
For example, consider the sentence <strong>""He found a pen, a book and a flashlight""</strong>. Here, <em>""found""</em> verb should be linked to all the 3 items.</p>

<p>Another example, <strong>""He was tested negative for cancer, anemia and diabetes""</strong>. Here, the word <em>""negative""</em> should be linked to the three diseases. </p>

<p>Is this possible with any of the open-source NLP packages like OpenNLP or Stanford CoreNLP? Any other solution?
<br><br><br>
<strong>EDIT:</strong><br>
Like mentioned in one of the answers, my initial idea was to manually parse the list and find the items by looking at the placement of commas, etc.</p>

<p>But then I discovered Stanford NLP's OpenIE model. This seems to be doing a pretty good job. <br>For example, <strong>""He has a pen and a book""</strong> gives the 2 relations <strong>(He;has;a pen)</strong> and <strong>(He;has;a book)</strong>. </p>

<p>The problem with the model is that it doesn't work for incomplete sentences like, <strong>""has a pen and a book""</strong>. <br>(From what I understood, this is because OpenIE can only extract triples)<br>
It also fails when negations are involved. Eg, <strong>""He has no pens""</strong>.</p>

<p>Is there a solution to these problems? What are the best solutions available currently for information extraction?</p>

Matching PoS tags with specific text with `testacy.extract.pos_regex_matches(...)`,"<p>I'm using <code>textacy</code>'s <code>pos_regex_matches</code> method to find certain chunks of text in sentences.</p>

<p>For instance, assuming I have the text: <code>Huey, Dewey, and Louie are triplet cartoon characters.</code>, I'd like to detect that <code>Huey, Dewey, and Louie</code> is an enumeration.</p>

<p>To do so, I use the following code (on <code>testacy 0.3.4</code>, the version available at the time of writing):</p>

<pre><code>import textacy

sentence = 'Huey, Dewey, and Louie are triplet cartoon characters.'
pattern = r'&lt;PROPN&gt;+ (&lt;PUNCT|CCONJ&gt; &lt;PUNCT|CCONJ&gt;? &lt;PROPN&gt;+)*'
doc = textacy.Doc(sentence, lang='en')
lists = textacy.extract.pos_regex_matches(doc, pattern)
for list in lists:
    print(list.text)
</code></pre>

<p>which prints:</p>

<pre><code>Huey, Dewey, and Louie
</code></pre>

<p>However, if I have something like the following:</p>

<pre><code>sentence = 'Donald Duck - Disney'

<p>then the <code>-</code> (dash) is recognised as <code>&lt;PUNCT&gt;</code> and the whole sentence is recognised as a list -- which it isn't.</p>

<p>There are thousands of such text files and they may have different section headings as shown in these examples:</p>

<li><a href=""https://pastebin.com/9Up4RWHu"" rel=""noreferrer"">https://pastebin.com/9Up4RWHu</a></li>
</ol>

<p>I started off by reading the files</p>

<pre><code>from glob import glob

txtPth = '../tr-txt/*.txt'
txtFiles = glob(txtPth)

with open(txtFiles[0],'r') as tf:
    allLines = [line.rstrip() for line in tf]

sectionHeading = ['Corporate Participants',
                  'Conference Call Participiants',
                  'Presentation',
                  'Questions and Answers']

for lineNum, line in enumerate(allLines):
    if line in sectionHeading:
        print(lineNum,allLines[lineNum])
</code></pre>

<p>My idea was to look for the line numbers where section headings existed and try to extract the content in between those line numbers, then strip out separators like dashes. That didn't work and I got stuck in trying to create a dictionary of this kind so that I can later run various natural language processing algorithms on quarried items. </p>

<pre><code>{file-name1:{
    {date-time:[string]},
    {corporate-name:[string]},
    {corporate-participants:[name1,name2,name3]},
    {call-participants:[name4,name5]},
    {section-headings:{
        {heading1:[
            {name1:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name2:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name3:[speechOrderNum, text-content]}],
        {heading2:[
            {name1:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name2:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name3:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name2:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name1:[speechOrderNum, text-content]},
            {name4:[speechOrderNum, text-content]}],
        {heading3:[text-content]},
        {heading4:[text-content]}
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>

<p>The challenge is that different files may have different headings and number of headings. But there will always be a section called ""Presentation"" and very likely to have ""Question and Answer"" section. These section headings are always separated by a string of equal-to signs. And content of different speaker is always separated by string of dashes. The ""speech order"" for Q&amp;A section is indicated with a number in square brackets. The participants are are always indicated in the beginning of the document with an asterisks before their name and their tile is always on the next line. </p>

<p>Any suggestion on how to parse the text files is appreciated. The ideal help would be to provide guidance on how to produce such a dictionary (or other suitable data structure) for each file that can then be written to a database. </p>

Does an algorithm exist to help detect the &quot;primary topic&quot; of an English sentence?,"<p>I'm trying to find out if there is a known algorithm that can detect the ""key concept"" of a sentence.</p>

<li>Our system identifies the concepts of the sentence (chicken, turkey)</li>
<li>And it runs a search of our corpus content</li>

<p>The area that we're lacking in is identifying what the core ""topic"" of the sentence is really about.

Preserve lines in Stanford CoreNLP,"<p>From <a href=""https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://nlp.stanford.edu/software/tokenizer.html</a> , the Stanford tokenizer has the option <code>-preserveLines</code> to preserve the line breaks determined by the <code>\n</code> in a text file.</p>

<p>But in CoreNLP, there is the <code>ssplit</code> that splits the sentences and breaks the lines up. </p>

<p>So given the text file:</p>

<pre><code>生告激効雑題鹿際写徹輝万。最協領野京部習頂経日交日考当備。
foo foo bar bar.
</code></pre>

<p>The desired output to just tokenize the file should be:</p>

<pre><code>生 告 激効 雑題 鹿際 写 徹輝万 。 最協領 野京部 習頂経 日 交日 考 当備 。
foo foo bar bar .
</code></pre>

<p>Using the Chinese CoreNLP models:</p>

<pre><code>wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31.zip
unzip stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31.zip
cp stanford-corenlp-full-2016-10-31/stanford-corenlp-3.7.0.jar .
wget http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-english-corenlp-2016-10-31-models.jar

java -mx10g -cp ""*"" edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.StanfordCoreNLP -props stanford-tools/StanfordCoreNLP-chinese.tokenize.properties -file input.txt -outputFormat text
</code></pre>

<p>And the <code>stanford-chinese.properties</code> file should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>annotators = segment, ssplit
customAnnotatorClass.segment = edu.stanford.nlp.pipeline.ChineseSegmenterAnnotator
segment.model = edu/stanford/nlp/models/segmenter/chinese/ctb.gz
segment.sighanCorporaDict = edu/stanford/nlp/models/segmenter/chinese
segment.serDictionary = edu/stanford/nlp/models/segmenter/chinese/dict-chris6.ser.gz
segment.sighanPostProcessing = true
ssplit.boundaryTokenRegex = [.]|[!?]+|[。]|[！？]+
</code></pre>

<p>(Note: the Stanford CoreNLP for chinese don't write to file if the <code>ssplit</code> isn't used, see <a href=""https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP/issues/409"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">https://github.com/stanfordnlp/CoreNLP/issues/409</a>)</p>

<p>And the output produces 3 lines instead of 2:</p>

<p>Using <code>-preserveLines</code> option with the following command yields the same result:</p>

"Given a dictionary and a list of letters, make a program learn to generate valid words | Javascript","<p>I'm working on a big machine learning/nlp project and I'm stuck at a small part of it. (PM me, if you want to know what I'm working on exactly.)</p>

<p>I try to code a program in Javascript that learns to generate valid words, only by using all letters of the alphabet.</p>

<p>What I have is a database of 500K different words. It's a big JS object, structured like this (the words are german):</p>

<pre><code>database = {
    ""um"": {id: 1, word: ""um"", freq: 10938},
    ""oder"": {id: 2, word: ""oder"", freq: 10257},
    ""Er"": {id: 3, word: ""Er"", freq: 9323},
    ...
}
</code></pre>

<p><code>""freq""</code> means frequency obviously. (Maybe this value sometimes gets important but I currently don't use it, so just ignore it.)
<hr>
The way my program currently works is:
In the first iteration, it generates a completely random word between 2 and 13 letters long and searches for it in the database. If it's there, every letter in the word gets a good rating, if it's not there, they get a bad rating. Also the word length gets rated. If the word is valid, its word length gets a good rating, if it's not, its word length gets a bad rating.</p>

<p>In the iterations after that first one, it doesn't generate a word with <strong>random</strong> letters and a <strong>random</strong> word length. It uses probabilities based on the ratings of the letters and the word length.</p>

<p>For example, let's say it found the words ""the"", ""so"" and ""if"" after the first 100 iterations. So the letters ""t"", ""h"", ""e"" and the letters ""s"", ""o"", and the letters ""i"", ""f"" are good rated, and the word length of 2 and 3 is also good rated. So the word generated in the next iteration will more likely contain these good rated letters than bad rated letters.</p>

<p>Of course, the program also checks if the currently generated word already was generated and if so, then this word doesn't get rated again and it generates a new one.</p>

<p>In theory it should learn the optimal letter frequency and the optimal word-length-frequency by its own and sometimes only generate valid words.</p>

<p>Yeah. Of course this doesn't work. It gets better for the first few iterations, but as soon as it has found all the 2-lettered words it gets worse. I think my whole way how I do this is wrong. I've actually tried it out and have a (not so beautiful) graph after 5000 iterations for you:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/bgT7T.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/bgT7T.png"" alt=""(not so beautiful) graph""></a></p>

Word2Vec: Is it possible to train with respect to weight in NLP?,"<p>I used <code>Gensim</code>'s <code>Word2Vec</code> for training most similar words.</p>

</ul>

<p>From some research in the area it seems that a lot of the existing machine learning packages are around classification, regression and clustering (e.g <a href=""http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://scikit-learn.org/stable/</a>), while what I am trying to do is a form of translation.</p>

<p>I have also looked into a few NLP packages, and the functionality falls more into the keyword identification, word type identification and sentiment analysis (e.g <a href=""http://www.nltk.org/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www.nltk.org/</a>).

Multilingual Named Entity Linking,"<p>I am working on a clustering algorithm to cluster news articles from different sources into one event similar to what Google News does. Everything is working well, except for one problem.  </p>

<p>I am clustering Arabic news articles, and the algorithm is working very good, it is showing very good results on Politics and Sports articles, but when it comes to Games and Technology, the results are not that good. The problem is I am having a very low recall (fewer clusters than should have).  </p>

<p>After investigating, I found that the problem is with named entities. In Games and Tech, authors seem to be mixing between using English names, or Arabic equivalent name, and this is affecting the title terms weighing the most, which affect the final results in general.  </p>

<p>Now, I am looking for a way to find equal named entities even if they are in different languages. I still don't know how exactly, and I appreciate any help.</p>

Calculating grammar similarity between two sentences,"<p>I'm making a program which provides some english sentences which user has to learn more.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>First, I provide a sentence <em>""I have to go school today""</em> to user.
  Then if the user wants to learn more sentences like that, I find some sentences which have high grammar similarity with that sentence.</p>

<p>I think the only way for providing sentences is to calculate similarity.</p>

<p>Is there a way to calculate grammar similarity between two sentences?</p>

Natural Language Processing: Find obscenities in English?,"<p>Given a set of words tagged for part of speech, I want to find those that are obscenities in mainstream English. How might I do this? Should I just make a huge list, and check for the presence of anything in the list? Should I try to use a regex to capture a bunch of variations on a single root?</p>

<p>If it makes it easier, I don't want to filter out, just to get a count. So if there are some false positives, it's not the end of the world, as long as there's a more or less uniformly over exaggerated rate.</p>

NLTK Performance,"<p>Alright, I've been pretty interested in natural language processing recently: however, I've used C until now for most of my work. I heard of NLTK, and I didn't know Python, but it seems quite easy to learn, and it's looking like a really powerful and interesting language. In particular, the NLTK module seems very, very adapted to what I need to do.</p>

<p>However, when using <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/526469/practical-examples-of-nltk-use"">sample code for NLTK</a> and pasting that into a file called <code>test.py</code>, I've noticed it takes a very, very long time to run ! </p>

<p>I'm calling it from the shell like so:</p>

<pre><code>time python ./test.py
</code></pre>

<p>And on a 2.4 GHz machine with 4 GBs of RAM, it takes 19.187 seconds ! </p>

<p>Now, maybe this is absolutely normal, but I was under the impression that NTLK was <em>extremely</em> fast; I may have been mistaken, but is there anything obvious that I'm clearly doing wrong here?</p>

Fix CoreNLP sentence splitting with European dates,"<p>Stanford CoreNLP does not work with many common European date formats (c.f. <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_Europe"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Date and time notation in Europe (Wikipedia)</a>).</p>

<p>We all know that date parsing is a mess, in particular the <a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/VSr0j.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">crazy mm-dd-yyyy format the U.S. uses</a>. Nevertheless, CoreNLP is unable to process even basic European date formats, because it splits too aggressively on dots.</p>

<p>However, date information is often presented e.g. as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Die Terroranschläge am 11. September 2001, einem Dienstag, waren vier koordinierte Flugzeugentführungen mit anschließenden Selbstmordattentaten ... <a href=""https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terroranschl%C3%A4ge_am_11._September_2001"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">(Wikipedia)</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Whatever I try, CoreNLP splits this into:</p>

<pre><code>1. Die Terroranschläge am 11.
2. September 2001, einem Dienstag, waren vier [...]
</code></pre>

<p>making CoreNLP largely unusable for German NLP. The dot simply marks this as ordinal numbers, i.e. this is the German way of writing ""11th September 2001"". You will also see the Notation ""11. 9. 2001"" in German frequently, CoreNLP thinks <code>9.</code> is another sentence, and also ""11. Sept. 2001""</p>

<p>Is there any hook (e.g. overriding some method) that would allow me to define patterns to re-join incorrectly split sentences with own rules? For example, <code>[123]?\d\. 1?\d\.</code> would be typical for dates, and there are not many months...</p>

How to make a TF vector?,"<p>I want to make a TF vector for a word sense disambiguation project. I have some files, each for an ambiguated word which contains a Persian sentence, a tab and then an English word (which shows the sense of the ambiguated word) in each line. I extracted the 1000 most frequent words of the file and I have to make a TF vector according to this words. (The TF formula is: 𝑇𝐹𝑖,𝑗=log(1+𝑛𝑖,𝑗)). So the output should be a file which has 1000 columns of numbers and a column for the English word. (1001 columns).</p>

<p>For that, first I omitted stop words and punctuation. Then I wrote a function to extract 1000 most frequent words. Then a function to calculate each word's frequency in the file and then I claculated 𝑇𝐹𝑖,𝑗=log(1+𝑛𝑖,𝑗). (𝑛𝑖,𝑗 is each word's frequency in the file), and put the result in a dictionary (""TFvauesl"" in the code). The problem is the TF function in the code.</p>

<p>1) for example if my file has 10 lines, it should return 10 lines in the output, too . But the code returns more than 10 lines. How should I correct it?</p>

<p>2) To make the TF vector I have to say if the word in each line of the file (which I put them in the witouStops list), is in the most frequent words and also is in the TFvalues dictionary, instead of that word, it puts its value which is in TFvalues dictionary. The TF function which I wrote doesn't return correct answer. How can I change it?</p>

<p>3) As I said before, the output file should have 1000 columns of numbers and a column for the English word. my data file has some sentences in each line. They have between 5 to 9 words (more or less). for the words in each line, which are in the most frequent words, the code should put its TF value which is in TFvalues dictionary. Now the question is, for the rest of that 1000 most frequent words which are not in the lines, should I write ""0""? Is this the way we make TF vector? hint: I want to use weka for classifying, so the number of each line should be equall. All of them should have 1001 columns.</p>

Python regex: tokenizing English contractions,"<p>I am trying to parse strings in such a way as to separate out all word components, even those that have been contracted.  For example the tokenization of  ""shouldn't"" would be [""should"", ""n't""].</p>

<p>The nltk module does not seem to be up to the task however as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""I wouldn't've done that.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>tokenizes as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>['I', ""wouldn't"", ""'ve"", 'done', 'that', '.']</p>
</blockquote>

<p>where the desired tokenization of ""wouldn't've"" was: ['would', ""n't"", ""'ve""]</p>

<p>After examining common English contractions, I am trying to write a regex to do the job but I am having a hard time figuring out how to match ""'ve"" only once.  For example, the following tokens can all terminate a contraction:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>n't, 've, 'd, 'll, 's, 'm, 're</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But the token ""'ve"" can also follow other contractions such as:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>'d've, n't've, and (conceivably) 'll've</p>
</blockquote>

<p>At the moment, I am trying to wrangle this regex:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>\b[a-zA-Z]+(?:('d|'ll|n't)('ve)?)|('s|'m|'re|'ve)\b</p>
</blockquote>

<p>However, this pattern also matches the badly formed:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""wouldn't've've""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It seems the problem is that the third apostrophe qualifies as a word boundary so that the final ""'ve"" token matches the whole regex.</p>

<p>I have been unable to think of a way to differentiate a word boundary from an apostrophe and, failing that, I am open to advice for alternative strategies.</p>

<p>Also, I am curious if there is any way to include the word boundary special character in a character class.  According to the Python documentation, \b in a character class matches a backspace and there doesn't seem to be a way around this.</p>

<p>EDIT:</p>

<p>Here's the output:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt;pattern = re.compile(r""\b[a-zA-Z]+(?:('d|'ll|n't)('ve)?)|('s|'m|'re|'ve)\b"")
&gt;&gt;&gt;matches = pattern.findall(""She'll wish she hadn't've done that."")
&gt;&gt;&gt;print matches
[(""'ll"", '', ''), (""n't"", ""'ve"", ''), ('', '', ""'ve"")]
</code></pre>

<p>I can't figure out the third match.  In particular, I just realized that if the third apostrophe were matching the leading \b, then I don't know what would be matching the character class [a-zA-Z]+.</p>

What Is the Difference Between POS Tagging and Shallow Parsing?,"<p>I'm currently taking a Natural Language Processing course at my University and still confused with some basic concept. I get the definition of POS Tagging from the <a href=""http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/fsnlp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">Foundations of Statistical Natural Language Processing</a> book:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tagging is the task of labeling (or tagging) each word in a sentence
  with its appropriate part of speech. We decide whether each word is a
  noun, verb, adjective, or whatever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>But I can't find a definition of Shallow Parsing in the book since it also describe shallow parsing as one of the utilities of POS Tagging. So I began to search the web and found no direct explanation of shallow parsing, but in <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shallow_parsing"" rel=""noreferrer"">Wikipedia</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Shallow parsing (also chunking, ""light parsing"") is an analysis of a sentence which identifies the constituents (noun groups, verbs, verb groups, etc.), but does not specify their internal structure, nor their role in the main sentence.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I frankly don't see the difference, but it may be because of my English or just me not understanding simple basic concept. Can anyone please explain the difference between shallow parsing and POS Tagging? Is shallow parsing often also called Shallow Semantic Parsing?</p>

<p>Thanks before.</p>

How Can I Add More Languages to Stopwords in NLTK?,"<p>I'm using NLTK with stopwords to detect the language of a document using the method described by Alejandro Nolla at <a href=""http://blog.alejandronolla.com/2013/05/15/detecting-text-language-with-python-and-nltk/"" rel=""noreferrer"">http://blog.alejandronolla.com/2013/05/15/detecting-text-language-with-python-and-nltk/</a> , and it works reasonably well.</p>

<p>I'm also working with some additional languages not included in the NLTK stopwords package, such as Czech and Romanian, and they get false matches as other languages. These are the languages in stopwords:</p>

<p>['danish', 'dutch', 'english', 'finnish', 'french', 'german', 'hungarian', 'italian', 'norwegian', 'portuguese', 'russian', 'spanish', 'swedish', 'turkish']</p>

<p>How can I expand the list of languages supported by NLTK? Are there other stopword lists available that I can add? Is there a documented method I can use to create an add my own stopword lists?</p>

N-grams: Explanation + 2 applications,"<p>I want to implement some applications with n-grams (preferably in PHP). </p>

<hr>

<p>Which type of n-grams is more adequate for most purposes? A word level or a character level n-gram? How could you implement an n-gram-tokenizer in PHP?</p>

<hr>

<p>First, I would like to know what N-grams exactly are. Is this correct? It's how I understand n-grams:</p>

<p>Sentence: ""I live in NY.""</p>

<p>word level bigrams (2 for n): ""# I', ""I live"", ""live in"", ""in NY"", 'NY #'</p>

<p>character level bigrams (2 for n): ""#I"", ""I#"", ""#l"", ""li"", ""iv"", ""ve"", ""e#"", ""#i"", ""in"", ""n#"", ""#N"", ""NY"", ""Y#""</p>

<p>When you have this array of n-gram-parts, you drop the duplicate ones and add a counter for each part giving the frequency:</p>

<p>word level bigrams: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]</p>

<p>character level bigrams: [2, 1, 1, ...]</p>

<p>Is this correct?</p>

<hr>

<p>Furthermore, I would like to learn more about what you can do with n-grams:</p>

<ul>
<li>How can I identify the language of a text using n-grams?</li>
<li>Is it possible to do machine translation using n-grams even if you don't have a bilingual corpus?</li>
<li>How can I build a spam filter (spam, ham)? Combine n-grams with a Bayesian filter?</li>
<li>How can I do topic spotting? For example: Is a text about basketball or dogs? My approach (do the following with a Wikipedia article for ""dogs"" and ""basketball""): build the n-gram vectors for both documents, normalize them, calculate Manhattan/Euclidian distance, the closer the result is to 1 the higher is the similarity</li>
</ul>

<p>What do you think about my application approaches, especially the last one?</p>

<p>I hope you can help me. Thanks in advance!</p>

Stanford NLP sentiment ambiguous result,"<p>I am using <strong>Stanford NLP v3.6</strong> (<strong>JAVA</strong>) to calculate <strong>sentiment</strong> of <strong>English</strong>  sentences.</p>

<p>Stanford NLP calculates the polarity of the sentence from 0 to 4.</p>

<ul>
<li>0 very negative</li>
<li>1 negative</li>
<li>2 neutral</li>
<li>3 positive</li>
<li>4 very positive </li>
</ul>

<p>I run some very simple test cases but got very strange result.</p>

<p>Example : </p>

<ol>
<li>Text = Jhon is good person, Sentiment = 3 (i.e <strong>positive</strong>)</li>
<li>Text = David is good person, Sentiment = 2 (i.e <strong>neutral</strong>)</li>
</ol>

<p>In above example, the sentences are same, other that the name <code>David</code>, <code>Jhon</code>, but sentiment values are different. <strong>Isn't this ambiguity</strong>?</p>

<p>I used this Java code for calculating sentiment: </p>

<pre><code> public static float calSentiment(String text) {

            // pipeline must get initialized before proceeding further
            Properties props = new Properties();
            props.setProperty(""annotators"", ""tokenize, ssplit,   parse, sentiment"");

            int mainSentiment = 0;
            if (text != null &amp;&amp; text.length() &gt; 0) {
                int longest = 0;
                Annotation annotation = pipeline.process(text);

                for (CoreMap sentence : annotation.get(CoreAnnotations.SentencesAnnotation.class)) {
                    Tree tree = sentence.get(SentimentCoreAnnotations.SentimentAnnotatedTree.class);
                    int sentiment = RNNCoreAnnotations.getPredictedClass(tree);
                    String partText = sentence.toString();

                    if (partText.length() &gt; longest) {
                        mainSentiment = sentiment;
                        longest = partText.length();
                    }
                }
            }
            if (mainSentiment &gt; 4 || mainSentiment &lt; 0) {
                return -9999;
            }
            return mainSentiment;

        }

toString methode for class inherrited from arrayList,"<p>I am doing some Natural Language Processing and therefore implemented a Sentence class is basically an ArrayList with some meta-information. I would like to write overwrite its toString() method, which simply pastes the Strings separated by spaces. I got it working by using the inherited get method, but I was wondering if it would be possible and better (in terms of efficiency and coding praxis) to access the fields directly.</p>

<p>Here is a simplified version of my class:</p>

<pre><code>public class Sentence extends ArrayList&lt;String&gt; {
    int sentimentScore;
    String Speaker;

    @Override
    public String toString(){

            sb.append(super.get(i));
            sb.append("" "");
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }

How to read the cedict (a space separated file) with regex groups?,"<p><a href=""https://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=cc-cedict"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">CEDICT</a> is a resource for Chinese text analysis</p>

<p>There are 4 columns to the files and they are separated by spaces. Any spaces after the 4th is considered as one. Lines that starts with <code>#</code> needs to be skipped. </p>

<p>E.g. for the line: </p>

<blockquote>

<p>Currently to read the file I've been tried using a mix of <code>str.split</code> and <code>re.findall</code> and skipping lines by <code>str.startswith()</code>, i.e.:</p>

<pre><code>import re

        # Note: lines are NOT separated by tabs.
        line = line.strip()
        trad, sim, *stuff = line.split()

        entry = DictEntry(traditional=trad, simplified=sim, pinyin=pinyin, glosses=glosses)

<p>I've also tried this regex with 4 groups:</p>

<pre><code>(.*)\s(.*)\s(\[([^]]*)\])\s(\/.*\/)

<p>It's apparently a range field. From what I've gathered, say we type a prefix Tamp, then from there we can stem to different possibility and a range query works with prefix + [range of character in numeric]? </p>

I tried with Russian too, and it also worked great. However, when I try with some Japanese text, the algorithm does not work as intended anymore.</p>

<p>The problem arises from the fact that Japanese language does not have spaces, so that TfidfVectorizer does not understand what's a word and what isn't. For example I would have something like this in my unigram vocabulary:</p>

Proper way of eliminating letter repetitions from English words?,"<p>As the title clearly describes, I wonder what is the right way to eliminate character repetitions in English that are commonly used in social media to exaggerate the feeling.

Determining gender of words,"<p>I'm looking to anonymise text, and one of the tasks is to remove references to the gender of a person being referenced. It is OK, but not preferable, if a little bit of meaning is lost (a pragmatic consequence of the fact this would be automated).</p>

How to test SyntaxNet trained model (Spanish UD)?,"<p>Training my own SyntaxNet model for Spanish-Ancora UD corpus following the instructions from <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/syntaxnet"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a> did not give me errors.</p>

<p>After all the steps the final files it creates were:</p>

<pre><code>-category-map

-context  
-graph

</code></pre>

<p>The context.pbtxt file used for the training was the one from syntaxnet/models/parsey_universal.</p>

<p>Then when I try to test it calling <code>parser.sh</code> from syntaxnet/models/parsey_universal return a couple errors:  </p>

<pre><code>F syntaxnet/term_frequency_map.cc:63] Check failed: ::tensorflow::Status::OK() == (tensorflow::Env::Default()-&gt;NewRandomAccessFile(filename, &amp;file)) (OK vs. Not found: syntaxnet/models/parsey_universal/modeltest/char-ngram-map)

<p>Then I downloaded the Spanish pretrained model from <a href=""https://github.com/tensorflow/models/blob/master/syntaxnet/universal.md"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>. And I checked the files. It seems like there are two missing files, the pretrained model has it by default but in the one I trained, these files were missing.</p>

<p>So my questions are how to get these files in the SyntaxNet training phase?<br>
there are other ways to produce them?<br>
should I test it in a different way?</p>

Detect language changes in file using Python,"<p>I need to detect language changes in a file, and tag each word accordingly. I've come up with a hacky way, that works for 2 languages (english and greek).</p>

<p>The script is this:</p>

<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env python
# -*- coding: utf-8 -*-
import sys

#open file
filename = sys.argv[1]
f = open(filename,'r')
content = f.read()
f.close()


#initialize new content
newSentence=''
#for every line, if the first letter of the token isn't ascii, it's nonsense, tag it.
for line in content.split('\n'):
    newSentence+='\n'
    for token in line.split():
        try:
            result = token[0].decode('ascii','ignore')
            newSentence += ' /en'+token
        except:
            newSentence += ' /gr'+token


print newSentence

f=open(filename+'_new.txt','w')
f.write(newSentence)
f.close()
</code></pre>

<p>The main idea is that if the first letter of each word isn't ascii decodeable it mustn't be english,so it's the only other option.</p>

<p>Now i realize this is awfully hacky and I'd like to know how would I go about doing it in a more pythonic way? Even in a way that works for multiple languages in a document.</p>

<p>PS. I know how to detect language in a document in general, however I was wondering if there was faster way to detecting just the changes without invoking tools such as nltk etc.</p>

Programming tips with Japanese Language/Characters,"<p>I have an idea for a few web apps to write to help me, and maybe others, learn Japanese better since I am studying the language.</p>

<p>My problem is the site will be in mostly english, so it needs to mix fluently Japanese Characters, usually hirigana and katakana, but later kanji. I am getting closer to accomplishing this; I have figured out that the pages and source files need to be unicode and utf-8 content types.</p>

<p>However, my problem comes in the actual coding. What I need is to manipulate strings of text that are kana.  One example is:</p>

<p>けす I need to take that verb and convert it to the te-form けして. I would prefer to do this in javascript as it will help down the road to do more manipulation, but if I have to will just do DB calls and hold everything in a DB.</p>

<p>My question is not only how to do it in javascript, but what are some tips and strategies to doing these kinds of things in other languages, too.  I am hoping to get more into doing language learning apps, but am lost when it comes to this.</p>

How can I learn *practical* natural language processing?,"<p>I have some background in Java, Pascal, PERL, SQL, &amp; R and would like to find a reasonably least resistance path from that background to doing automated or semi-automated extraction of concepts from text and turning the result into something statistically analyzable (willing to learn new languages if needed).  I imagine I will need to perform some NLP tasks on a few thousand pages of text, particularly POS processing, identification of noun phrases, word sense disambiguation.  The latter, I believe, may require semi-supervised machine learning for accuracy.  The question I have is where to start learning <strong>practical</strong> NLP?  Taking a course or reading NLP books seem to involve getting into far more detail about how NLP tasks are conducted than I need now--I just need to know what it does, how accurate it is, and what alternatives there are.  Jumping into some existing NLP framework seems to get me stuck.  I've used GATE for POS processing, but the output was either in XML, which I have no idea how to further process, or in postgresql, which was a bear to manipulate w/ SQL to generate statistical data.  Also, at the time, GATE had no good method for extracting word sense.</p>

Compute probability of sentence with out of vocabulary words,"<p>I trained Ngram language models (unigram and bigram) on a corpus of English and I'm trying to compute the probabilities of sentences from a disjoint corpus.</p>

<p>For example, the training corpus consists of the 3 sentences:</p>

<p><strong>1: I, am, Sam</strong></p>

<p><strong>2: Sam, I, am</strong></p>

<p><strong>3: I, do, not, like, green, eggs, and, ham</strong></p>

<p>N = 14 (length of the corpus)</p>

<p>For unigram, I end up with probabilities:</p>

<p>Pr(""i"") = #(""i"") / N = 3/14, Pr(""am"") = 2/14, Pr(""like"") = 1/14, and so forth...</p>

<p>For bigram, I end up with probabilities:</p>

<p>Pr(""am""|""i"") = 2/3, Pr(""do""|""i"") = 1/3, and so forth...</p>

<p>Now, I'm trying to compute the probability of the following sentence where not all ngrams (uni or bi) appear in the training corpus:</p>

<p><strong>I, ate, a, burrito</strong></p>

<p>For unigram, I need the following probability estimates:</p>

<p>Pr(""i""), Pr(""ate""), Pr(""a""), and Pr(""burrito"")</p>

<p>and for bigram, I need the following probabilities estimates:</p>

<p>Pr(""ate""|""i""), Pr(""a""|""ate""), Pr(""burrito""|""a"")</p>

<p>Apparently not all unigrams (""ate"", ""burrito"") and bigrams (like (""i"", ""ate"")) appear in the training corpus.</p>

<p>I understand that you can do smoothing (like add-one smoothing) to deal with these cases:</p>

<p>For example, the vocabulary of the training corpus is</p>

<p><strong>i, am, sam, do, not, like, green, eggs, and, ham</strong></p>

<p>and you can expand the vocabulary by including new words from the new sentence:</p>

<p><strong>ate, a, burrito</strong></p>

<p>So the size of the expanded vocabulary would be V = 13</p>

<p>So for unigram, the original probability estimates Pr(w_i) = #(w_i)/N would be turned into (#(w_i) + 1) / (N + V)</p>

<p>So Pr(""i"") = 4/27, Pr(""am"") = 3/27, Pr(""sam"") = 3/27, Pr(""do"") = 2/27, Pr(""not"") = 2/27, Pr(""like"") = 2/27, Pr(""green"") = 2/27, Pr(""eggs"") = 2/27, Pr(""and"") = 2/27, Pr(""ham"") = 2/27</p>

<p>And for the 3 new words:
Pr(""ate"") = 1/27, Pr(""a"") = 1/27, Pr(""burrito"") = 1/27</p>

<p>And the these probabilities would still sum to 1.0</p>

<p>Though this can handle the cases where some ngrams were not in the original training set, you would have to know the set of ""new"" words when you estimate the probabilities using (#(w_i) + 1) / (N + V) (V = sum of vocabulary of the original training set (10), and the test corpus (3)). I think this is equivalent to assuming the all new unigram or bigram in the test corpus occur only once, no matter how many times they actually occur.</p>

<p>My question is this the way out-of-vocabulary tokens are typically handled when computing the probability of a sentence? </p>

<p>The NLTK module nltk.module.NGramModel seem be have been removed due to bugs <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/26443084/is-there-an-alternate-for-the-now-removed-module-nltk-model-ngrammodel"">nltk ngram model</a>, so I have to implement on my own. Another question: is there python modules other than NLTK that implements Ngram training and computing probability of a sentence ? </p>

How can I POS tag German texts?,"<p>I've been doing some natural language processing work. </p>

<p>For English POS tagging, it's rather simple because I only need to use built-in nltk functions. I want to process German texts similarly.</p>

os.environ['JAVAHOME'] = java_path
sentence = ""Man könnte Klöckner vorhalten, sich an ihre eigenen Appelle nicht zu halten. Doch niemand in der Union wagte das. Nicht einmal die von ihr attackierten Briefschreiber. Klöckner genießt im Moment Narrenfreiheit.""

gp1 = german_postagger1.tag(tokens)

Better Database Design for a Hierarchical Structure?,"<p>I've created a bilingual dictionary app<sup>1</sup>, and it's currently very simple, but we're going to be starting to develop the entries more fully and I'm trying to figure out the best database structure for it. Previous dictionary projects I've worked on have used xml (since dictionary entries are largely hierarchical), but I need to do it using a database.<sup>2</sup></p>

<p>This is what a typical, medium-complexity entry would look like (simplified a bit):
<hr />
<b>dar</b><br>
<em>/dār/</em></p>

<ul>
<li>noun

<ol>
<li>house, dwelling, abode<br>
<em>ar-rājl dkhul ad-dār</em>, ""The man entered the house.""</li>
<li>home<br>
<em>rjaƷna lid-dār</em>, ""We returned home.""</li>
</ol></li>
<li>verb

<ol>
<li>to turn<br>
<em>dūr li-yamīn</em>, ""Turn right.""</li>
<li>to turn around/about</li>
</ol></li>
</ul>

<hr />

<p>As you can see, one word can have multiple parts of speech, so ""part of speech"" can't simply be an attribute of Entry, it has to be related to the senses. Each pos can have multiple senses (numbered), and of course each sense could have multiple near-synonymous translations. Senses may also have example sentences (possibly more than one), but not always. Thinking of how the entry parts relate to each other, I came up with the following structure, using five tables:  </p>

<pre><code>Entry
-id
-headword
-pronunciation
-...

PartOfSpeech
-id
-entry (ForeignKey)
-pos

Sense
-id
-sense_number
-part_of_speech (ForeignKey)
-...

Translation
-id
-tr
-sense (ForeignKey)
-...

Example
-id
-ex
-ex_tr
-sense (ForeignKey)
-...
</code></pre>

<p>Or, in other words:</p>

<pre><code>                                  _ Translation
Entry -- PartOfSpeech -- Sense --|
                                  - Example
</code></pre>

<p>This seems simple and makes sense to me, but I'm wondering if it will be too complicated in the execution. For instance, to display a selection of entries, I would need to write several nested <code>for</code> loops (<code>for e in entries → for p in pos → for s in senses → for tr in translations</code>) — and all with reverse lookups! </p>

<p>And I don't think I could even edit a whole entry in the Django admin (unless it lets you somehow do an Inline of an Inline of an Inline). I'm going to build an editor interface anyway, but it's nice to be able to check things on the admin site when you want to.</p>

<p>Is there a better way to do this? I feel like there must be something clever that I'm missing.</p>

<p>Thanks,
Karen</p>

Cross-Lingual Word Sense Disambiguation,"<p>I am a beginner in computer programming and I am completing an essay on Parallel Corpora in Word Sense Disambiguation. 
Basically,  I intend to show that substituting a sense for a word translation simplifies the process of identifying the meaning of ambiguous words. I have already word-aligned my parallel corpus (EUROPARL English-Spanish) with GIZA++, but I don't know what to do with the output files. My intention is to build a classifier to calculate the probability of a translation word given the contextual features of the tokens which surround the ambiguous word in the source text.
So, my question is: how do you extract instances of an ambiguous word from a parallel corpus WITH its aligned translation?</p>

<p>I have tried various scripts on Python, but these are run on the assumption that 1) the English and Spanish texts are in separate corpora and 2) the English and Spanish sentences share the same indexes, which obviously does not work. 
e.g.</p>

<pre><code>def ambigu_word2(document, document2):
    words = ['letter']
    for sentences in document:
        tokens = word_tokenize(sentences)
        for item in tokens:
            x = w_lemma.lemmatize(item)
            for w in words:
                if w == x in sentences:
                    print (sentences, document2[document.index(sentences)])
print (ambigu_word2(raw1, raw2))
</code></pre>

<p>I would be really grateful if you could provide any guidance on this matter.</p>

calculate the totall number of uniqe words of the first column of a list,"<p>I have a file that consists of many Persian sentences. each line contains a sentence, then a ""tab"", then a word, again a ""tab"" and then an English word. I have to know just the number of unique words of the sentences (the words after tabs should not be in calculation). For that I changed the file to a list, so I have a list that contains a lot of lines and each line contains three indices; the sentence, a Persian word, an English word. Now I can achieve the sentences. The problem is that, the code I wrote returns the number of unique words of each line separately. For example if the file has 100 lines it returns 100 numbers, each in a new line. But I want the summation of all the numbers and have just one number which shows the total number of unique words. How can I change the code?</p>

Differentiate between sentences that have the same meaning but use different word combinations,"<p>I am trying to learn Natural Language Processing and an stuck with an open ended question.

There is a man and a lion. If the lion catches the man he dies. The lion will chase the man if he sees him.

You have a lion that chases men on seeing them. There is one man. If the lion catches the man he dies.

Junit: Unit Testing for big data natural language processing,"<p>My problem is a tad vague but my question is specific.</p>

<p><strong>QUESTION</strong></p>

<p>Can anyone point me to well-informed documentation on how to unit test big data natural language processing systems?</p>

<p><strong>CONTEXT</strong></p>

<p>Big data processing systems are often multi-threaded and are also highly forgiving of Exception states. Very often Exceptions are caught and not thrown in order to allow for ""messy"" data.</p>

<p>However, in unit testing such systems, levels of stringency should be higher than in production conditions. This level of stringency allows developers to at least be aware of what kind of conditions throw exceptions.</p>

Best parser algorithm for lexical structure transfer?,"<p>As part of a bigger project I want to implement a machine translator from language <em>A</em> to language <em>B</em>. Since there are not available tools that automatically do machine translation over this set of languages, and the available corpus of language B is quite small, <strong>I am trying to do the following</strong>:</p>

<p><strong>1.</strong> Given a sentence in language <em>A</em>, use a tool to get its set of language <em>A</em> PoS (Part-of-speech) tags.</p>

<p><strong>2.</strong> The tool I am using for PoS tagging (Freeling) does not return a parse tree, so I thought on building my own parse tree from the set of tags.</p>

<p><strong>3.</strong> After the parse tree is completed, traverse it by levels (starting on the root) and reorder its elements according to the grammar rules of language <em>B</em>.</p>

what is the format of word alignments in machine translation?,"<p>I am reading <a href=""http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P05-1032"" rel=""nofollow"">this</a> paper and having a difficulty understanding the way word alignments are represented. To be precise, right below section <code>4.1</code>, the authors say the format of the alignment is <code>(i,j)</code> where <code>i</code> ranges within the source sentence length and <code>j</code> ranges within the target sentence range. This means that each alignment is a pair of two numbers, which given that sentences are typically not longer than 40-100 words, values for <code>i</code>, and <code>j</code> can be stored using <code>short</code> type. So, I expect to see that the amount of space required to store these alignments be <code>2 x sizeof(short) x number of word alignments</code>. But if you go to the next page where, right above section <code>4.2</code>, they say the space is <code>sizeof(short) x number of word alignments</code>. WHY? Am I confusing stuff?</p>

Are there any off-the-shelf solutions for lexical analysis in Haskell that allow for a run-time dynamic lexicon?,"<p>I'm working on a small Haskell project that needs to be able to lex a very small subset of strictly formed English in to tokens for semantic parsing.  It's a very naïve natural language interface to a system with many different end effectors than can be issued commands.  I'm currently using Alex for this, but Alex relies on its lexicon to be statically compiled.  The nature of the system is such that the number and even type of end effectors in the world can increase as well as decrease after compilation, and so I need to be able to add or remove viable tokens from the lexicon at runtime.</p>

<p>I've tried looking around for dynamic lexing solutions, and the closest I could get was <a href=""http://www.nondot.org/sabre/Projects/HaskellLexer/"">this</a> Dynamic Lexer Engine that doesn't look to have been updated since 2000.</p>

<p>I've been considering some techniques like using a less-high level approach (Attoparsec, perhaps), or even wiring up a recompilation hook for Alex  and separating the lexer from the rest of the application.</p>

<p>Are there any well-known solutions for this sort of lexical analysis?  I intend on working through <a href=""http://nlpwp.org/book/index.xhtml"">Natural Language Processing for the Working Programmer</a> eventually so I can take a less simplified approach, but currently a basically lexer is what I need.</p>

How to extract lines numbers that match a regular expression in a text file,"<p>I'm doing a project on statistical machine translation in which I need to extract line numbers from a POS-tagged text file that match a regular expression (any non-separated phrasal verb with the particle 'out'), and write the line numbers to a file (in python).</p>

<p>I have this regular expression: '\w*_VB.?\sout_RP' and my POS-tagged text file: 'Corpus.txt'.
I would like to get an output file with the line numbers that match the above-mentioned regular expression, and the output file should just have one line number per line (no empty lines), e.g.:</p>

<p>2</p>

<p>5</p>

<p>44</p>

<p>So far all I have in my script is the following:</p>

<pre><code>OutputLineNumbers = open('OutputLineNumbers', 'w')
with open('Corpus.txt', 'r') as textfile:
    phrase='\w*_VB.?\sout_RP'
    for phrase in textfile: 

OutputLineNumbers.close()
</code></pre>

<p>Any idea how to solve this problem?</p>

Efficient clustering algorithm for nearly uniformly distributed data,"<p>I'm playing around with natural language processing and I'm trying to cluster news article titles. I turned the titles into vectors, but they are nearly uniformly distributed. There are small clusters of 2-3 news articles, but most news articles should be in their own clusters.</p>

<p>I tried using k-means, but articles rarely change clusters because the data is fairly uniform. The initial random clusters end up being the final clusters.</p>

<p>I tried agglomerative clustering and it works great for a small data set (a few hundred articles). However, it takes a long time because it's at least O(n^2).</p>

<p>Is there any efficient algorithm to cluster nearly uniformly distributed data?</p>

<p>For example, if my data is a set of real numbers, it could look like this:</p>

<p>1 2 3 4 4.1 5 6</p>

<p>In this case, the clusters should be: (1), (2), (3), (4, 4.1), (5), (6).
Is there a better way to do this than agglomerative clustering?</p>

Hibernate search Lucene accent insensitive search,"<p>I'm working on a J2E application with an Hibernate Search / Lucene intégration. I index Documents (and other entities) and want to make accent insensitive search on it (content and classes' fields). </p>

<p>I'm using the FrenchAnalyzer which is seems to be Case insensitive (that's good), but i'm surprised to see he doesn't do the same with accent... </p>

<p>After some search and documentation reading, I understand I have to implement my own analyzer, based on the French one and include a filter (the ASCIIFoldingFilter seems to be the one I need).</p>

<p>If I'm right, this means this customAnalyzer have to be applied on the Class index and on the queries. The result will be an index without accents.</p>

<p>Is that the good way todo ? Is there no param or conf attribute for the FrenchAnalyzer to ignore accents ? </p>

<p>thanks</p>

Correctly folding ASCII characters in Elasticsearch,"<p>I'm looking into supporting folding of non standard ASCII characters like <a href=""https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/guide/1.x/asciifolding-token-filter.html"" rel=""nofollow"">this guide</a> suggests.</p>

<p>When I execute</p>

<pre><code>GET /my_index/_analyze?analyzer=folding&amp;text=My œsophagus caused a débâcle
</code></pre>

<p>the following tokens are returned:</p>

<pre><code>sophagus, caused, a, d, b, cle
</code></pre>

<p>What I want to achieve is:</p>

<p>Variations of the spelling of words like ""école"" (e.g. ecole, ècole) should be treated as the same word.</p>

<p>Right now, if I execute</p>

<pre><code>GET /my_index/_analyze?analyzer=folding&amp;text=école ecole

Character classes used in ffi-aspell,"<p>I am trying to use the <a href=""https://rubygems.org/gems/ffi-aspell/versions/1.1.0"" rel=""nofollow"">ffi-aspell</a> gem to spell check a text. In order to do that, it seems that I have to extract the words by myself. I am trying to do that by applying <code>String#scan</code> to the text with a regex, but it does not seem straightforward.</p>

<p>What is the easiest way to define the class of characters that may appear in an ffi-aspell dictionary of some language? I want to make it available not only for English, so things like <code>/[a-zA-Z']/</code> for the character (or <code>/[a-zA-Z']+/</code> the word) does not work. <code>/[[:word:]]/</code> seems to capture characters that are not in the dictionary, such as numerals, and further does not match the apostrophe (single quote), which is frequently used in a word. Is there some documentation that defines the character set used in an ffi-aspell dictionary?</p>

How to use target label as feature in CRF++?,"<p>I'm trying to build a Chinese word segmentator as <a href=""http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Y09-2034"" rel=""nofollow"">this paper</a>. If I understand it correctly, they use a 2-tag segmentation approach with CRF++. My question is, how to make the tag transition in that paper (e.g.T(-1)C(0)T(0)) as a feature template in CRF++? For example,for such training data:</p>

<p>共 B</p>

<p>同 M</p>

<p>創 B</p>

<p>造 M</p>

<p>美 B &lt;- Current word</p>

<p>好 M</p>

<p>新 B</p>

<p>世 B</p>

<p>紀 M</p>

<p>Is it possible to have feature T(-1)C(0)T(0) -> M/美/B in CRF++? I've tried add feature tempalte such as U01:%x[-1,1]/%x[0,0]/%x[0,1] but that failed. I am also confused about that since the B/I tag is the tag we want to tag in the testing data(e.g. raw Chinese sentences), why it's possible to use the tag as feature in the paper? Or I misunderstood anything?</p>

<p>Spacy applies all nlp operations like POS tagging, Lemmatizing and etc all at once. It is like a pipeline for NLP that takes care of everything you need in one step. Applying pipe method tho is supposed to make the process a lot faster by multithreading the expensive parts of the pipeline. But I don't see big improvement in speed and my CPU usage is around 25% (only one of 4 cores working). I also tried to read the file in multiple chuncks and increase the batch of input texts:</p>

<pre><code>out = nlp.pipe([part1, part2, ..., part4], n_threads=-1)
</code></pre>

<p>but still the same performance. Is there anyway to speed up the process? I suspect that OpenMP feature should be enabled compiling Spacy to utilize multi-threading feature. But there is no instructions on how to do it on Windows. </p>

How to replace english abbreviated form to their dictionary form,"<p>I'm working on a system to analyze texts in english: I use stanford-core nlp to make sentences from whole documents and to make tokens from sentences. I also use the maxent tagger to get tokens pos tags. 
Now, considering that I use this corpus to build a supervised classifier, it would be good if I could replace any word like 're, 's, havin, sayin', etc. to its standard form(are, is, having, saying). I've been searching for some english dictionary file, but I don't know how to use it. There are so many distinct cases to consider that I don't think it's an easy task to realize: is there some similar work or whole project that I could use? </p>

Performance Issues With Natural Language Processing in MATLAB,"<p>For a class, I'm processing raw text documents (our examples include novels that can be downloaded from the Gutenberg project) and turning them into a dictionary data structure. For each word, I need to know which paragraph(s) it occurs in, and how many times in each paragraph.</p>

<p>The procedure can be divided roughly as</p>

<ol>
<li>Break document into words, removing whitespace, commas, periods, etc.</li>
<li>For each document, iterate over the words. Look up in dictionary. If the word exists, update its entry. If it doesn't exist, create a new entry.</li>
</ol>

<p>I'm doing this MATLAB because the rest of my work is in MATLAB and I didn't want to have to deal with another language/environment. It turns out MATLAB has some pretty good string processing functions. However, I'm disturbed by how slow my code is running. The first part I mentioned above is not a problem; I use a <code>parfor</code> loop and it goes pretty fast. The second part is where my problem is.</p>

<p>My initial attempt at creating this dictionary was to use structs, a MATLAB built-in data type. The idea was to create a struct called <code>dictionary</code>, whose field names are the actual words, e.g., <code>dictionary.the</code> or <code>dictionary.gnome</code> for the words 'the' and 'gnome.' This worked provided the word was a valid field name (it couldn't be a contraction, for instance). But it ran slow, so I sought a different solution. My next attempt was to use a <code>containers.Map</code>, which is MATLAB's equivalent of a hash map or dictionary object. (One of my coworkers informed me that MATLAB is somewhat inefficient at looking up field names of structs, whereas the hash table has O(1) lookup time.) However, making this substitution actually <em>slowed down</em> my performance!</p>

<p>At this point, I feel I've some pretty substantial attempts at optimizing my code and am starting to wonder if MATLAB is really a sensible choice here. I'm basically trying to figure out whether the slowness is a product of MATLAB or of me being a terrible programmer (normally MATLAB is quite fast when it comes to linear algebra, arrays, and matrices). Rather than have someone read over my code, I'd greatly appreciate whatever feedback the community has to offer on either of the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Does anyone do this type of thing (i.e., language processing) in MATLAB or a similar language, such as Python? If so, I'd like to try to benchmark some of my timings. (I've got a MacBook, 2.8 GHz processor, and I'm currently getting about 10-20K words per second.)</p></li>
<li><p>Is it possible I'd get better results if I switched to a compiled language like Java or C++? Ballpark estimate, what kind of improvement?</p></li>
</ul>

NLP Methodology in Python to find 3-Character Common Combinations,"<p>I have a real-world meets math world problem.  I'm creating cupcake molds that are 3x4 cavity to a mold.  Each mold cost $1,000 to make. </p>

<p>I have a set of characters A-Z (26) and I need to find an efficient combination of 3 letters.</p>

<p>ie., 
Option 1) Create 26 molds where each mold has a single character
Option 2) Create 13 molds where each mold has two characters
(i.e., 3x2 for A, 3x2 for B in an AB-mold)
Option 3) Create n molds where each mold has three characters</p>

<p>ie., based on tokenization of 3-letter combinations in the english language, is there a solution for common 3-letter pairing that each letter is at least represented once and the total mold count is &lt;13 (option 2)</p>

<p>For example, for Option 3) I would imagine there would be a single mold for 'ING' but perhaps also one for 'ION'</p>

<p>Is there a minimum number of trigraphs that would cover the entire alphabet?</p>

<p>I would like to return the word with it´s associated tag given <code>test_string</code> if and only if they have the adjective, noun morphological occurrence (e.g. <code>[Noun, NCFS00],[Adjective, AQ0FS0]</code>) this is what i done:</p>

How to determine if a string is English sentence or code?,"<p>Consider the following two strings, the first one is code, the second one is English sentence (phrase to be precise). How can I detect that the first one is code and the second is not. </p>

2. do something in English (not necessary to be a sentence).

<p>I'm thinking about counting special characters (such as ""="", "";"", ""++"", etc ), and set if to some threshold.  Are there any better ways to do this? Any Java libraries? </p>

<p>My assumption is that English sentences are pretty regular, it most likely contains only "","", ""."", ""_"", ""("", "")"", etc. They do not contains something like this: <code>write(""the whole lot of text"");</code></p>

Semi Natural language Search using Apache Solr,"<p>I did some analysis on Apache Solr and its pretty good to search data from various sources. 
The problem I am facing is how do I standardize my search grammar and translate search text into Solr query.</p>

<p>I have three types of file/database table to search from - namely Customer, Industry and Unit. The first keyword in the search box should be any of the three. After that, the user can define a fix set of criteria: </p>

<pre><code>Metrics : 0 or many (ex, exposure, income, revenue, loan_amt etc)
Dimension : 0 or many (Geography, region, etc)
</code></pre>

<p>Example:</p>

<pre><code>customer - Returns all customer data from customer core
customer income from Asia - Returns all customer income details who belongs to Asia 
customer income revenue from Asia - Returns all customer income and revenue details who belongs to Asia 
</code></pre>

Can I fix my grammar of text in Solr like

second key-value would be one or more region/geography

<ul>
<li>Language Detector (in ruby not in python :/)</li>
<li>Google Translate API v2 (No longer free, have to pay 20 bucks a month while i'm doing this project for academic purposes. Courtesy limit: 0 characters/day ) </li>

<li><a href=""http://pythonhosted.org/pyenchant/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Enchant</a> (it's not for python 2.7? I'm new to python, any guide? I bet this would be the one i need)</li>
<li>Wordnet from NLTK (i got no idea why ""wordnet.synsets"" is missing and only ""wordnet.Synset"" is available. the sample code in solution is not working for me as well T_T, probably versioning issue again?)</li>
<li>Store english words into list and compare if the word exist (yea, it's kinda bad approach while the sentences are from twitter and.. you knew that :P)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>WORKING SOLUTION</strong></p>

<p>Finally after a series of trying, the following is the working solution (alternative to the above list)</p>

<ul>
<li>Wiktionary API (Using Urllib2, and simplejson to parse it. then find if the key is -1 means the word doesn't exist. else it's english. of course, for use in twitter have to preprocess your word into no special character like @#,?!. For how to find the key would referencing here. <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15261465/simplejson-and-random-key-value"">Simplejson and random key value</a>)</li>
<li>Answer from Dogukan Tufekci (Ticked)(Weakness: Let say if the sentence shorter than 20 characters long have to install PyEnchant or it will return UNKNOWN. While PyEnchant is not supporting Python 2.7, means couldn't install and not working to less than 20 character sentence)</li>

"Detect contrast, comparison or example in an english sentence","<p>Is there any tool or technique available in NLP / machine learning so that I can easily detect presence of contrast, comparison or example in an English sentence? For example, lets consider the following sentences:</p>

  <li><p>Many <strong>atolls</strong> can be found in the Pacific Ocean;

  <li><p><strong>Unguents</strong>, <strong>such as</strong> first aid cream, Cortaid, Vick-Salve, and Deep heat, are found in most homes.</p></li>
  </ol>

Faster way to search strings in big file with python,"<p>I have two text files to be processed. Here is my situation:</p>

<ul>
<li>These two files are extremely big, one is 1.21 GB and another is 1.1 GB. Each of them contain about over 30 million lines of Chinese strings.</li>
<li>Each string in each file is unique.</li>
<li>I don't have to modify these files, once they're loaded, they will not change.</li>
</ul>

<p>The thing is, one of these file is corrupted. Let's call it N5. N5 should have each line of string looks like this: 'a5 b5 c5 d5 e5\tf5'</p>

<p>Instead, it is: 'a5b5 c5 d5 e5\tf5'</p>

<p>I am trying to recovery it from another file, let's call it N4, it looks like this: 'a4 b4 c4 d4\tf4'</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is using N4 to separate a5b5 in N5, which might have three results:</p>

<ol>
<li>'a4 b4 c4 d4' equals 'a5 b5 c5 d5'</li>
<li>'a4 b4 c4 d4' equals 'b5 c5 d5 e5'</li>
<li>There is no match for N4 in N5.</li>
</ol>

<p>In situation 1 and 2, I can get the answer. However, in 3, it takes about 140 seconds to complete the search in N4.</p>

Steps to generate parse tree from CYK Algorithm (Natural Language Processing),"<p>I am currently working on a project involving NLP. I have implemented a CKY identifier as given in Jurafsky and Martin (algorithm on page 450). The table so produced actually stores the nonterminals in the table (instead of the usual boolean values). However, the only issue I am getting is to retrieve the parse tree.</p>

<p>Here is an illustration of what my CKY identifier does: </p>

<p>This is my grammar</p>

<pre><code>          S -&gt; NP VP

          VP -&gt; VERB VP
          VP -&gt; ADVERB VP
          VP -&gt; VF
          VERB -&gt; 'VB' | 'VBN'
          NOUN -&gt; 'NN' | 'NP'
          VF -&gt; VERB FILENAME
          FILENAME -&gt; 'NN' | 'NP'
          ADVERB -&gt; 'RB'
          DET -&gt; 'AT'
</code></pre>

<p>And this is the algorithm:</p>

<pre><code>for j  from i to LENGTH(words) do
    table[j-1,j] = A where A -&gt; POS(word[j])
    for i from j-2 downto 0
        for k from i+1 to j-1
            table[i,j] = Union(table[i,j], A such that A-&gt;BC)
            where B is in table[i,k] and C is in table[k,j]
</code></pre>

<p>And this is what my parsing table looks like after being filled:</p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/3zIwQ.jpg"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/3zIwQ.jpg"" alt=""CKY Table filled as per algorithm mentioned""></a></p>

<p>Now that I know that since S resides in [0,5], the string has been parsed, and that for k = 1 (as per the algorithm given in Martin and Jurafsky), we have S -> table[0][2] table[2][5]
    i.e. S -> NP VP</p>

<p>The only issue I am getting is that I have been able to retrieve the rules used, but then they are in a jumbled format, i.e. not on the basis of their appearance in parse tree. Can someone suggest an algorithm to retrieve the correct parse tree?</p>

What is a regular expression for parsing out persian individual sentences?,"<p>I am looking for a good .NET regular expression that I can use for parsing out individual sentences from a Persian body of text.<br>
So I thought of using a pattern to do splitting like if a <code>.</code> <code>؟</code> <code>!</code>  <code>؛</code> follows a space and than do the split.<br>
in Persian language there is no Capital letter and the question mark is <code>؟</code> and its a right to left language. 
look at this example it has 4 sentences:</p>

<blockquote>

Set of rules for textual analysis - Natural language processing,"<p>Does there exist a guide with a set of rules for <em>textual analysis</em> / <em>natural language processing</em>?</p>

<p>Do you have some specific developed package (e.g. in Python) for textual sentiment analysis?</p>

<p>Here is the application I am faced with:</p>

<p>Let's say <strong>I have two dictionaries, A and B. A contains ""negative"" words, and B contains ""positive"" words.</strong> What I can do is <em>count</em> the negative and the positive number of words.</p>

<p>This created some issues, such as the following: let's suppose that ""<code>exceptionally</code>"" is a <code>positive</code> word, and ""<code>serious</code>"" is a <code>negative</code> word.</p>

<p>If I have the two words following each other, I have <code>""exceptionally serious""</code>. In such a case, the two words cancel each other, which means I have 1 negative and 1 positive word. This is not true, because in reality it is a <strong>double negative</strong>.</p>

<p>So, my question is, is there a <em>set of rules</em> I can apply so that I improve my code, or is there some <em>software</em> that already takes into account such mechanisms, and applies <em>textual sentiment analysis</em>? Is there some implementation which I can feed the dictionaries and provide me with textual sentiment after it applies a <em>set of rules such as double negatives</em>?</p>

Applied NLP: how to score a document against a lexicon of multi-word terms?,"<p>This is probably a fairly basic NLP question but I have the following task at hand: I have a collection of text documents that I need to score against an (English) lexicon of terms that could be 1-, 2-, 3- etc <code>N</code>-word long. <code>N</code> is bounded by some ""reasonable"" number but the distribution of various terms in the dictionary for various values of <code>n = 1, ..., N</code> might be fairly uniform.

How to use lexicon dictionary in c#,"<p>i am working on sentiment analysis in c#, I have done preprocessing, and the next part is lexicon based analysis, for which I have found English Lexicon of about 6800 word <a href=""https://www.cs.uic.edu/~liub/FBS/sentiment-analysis.html#lexicon"" rel=""nofollow"">lexicon by Professor Bing Liu </a> which contains two text files, one for positive and other is for negative. </p>

How to deal with different sizes of sentences when giving them as input to a Neural Network?,"<p>I am giving a sentence as input to a tree structured Neural Network, where the leaf nodes will be the word vectors of the words in the sentence. </p>

<p>That tree will be a <a href=""https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Branching_(linguistics)"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">binarized constituency</a>(see the binary vs n-ary branching section) parse tree. </p>

<p>I am trying to develop a semantic representation of the sentence. </p>

<p><strong>The problem is</strong>, that since each sentence will have a different parse tree and different lengths, each sentence will have a different neural network. Due to this ever changing structure of neural network, I can't train it.</p>

<p>But this paper develops a tree structured Neural network using constituency and dependency based parse trees-</p>

<p>1) <a href=""http://arxiv.org/pdf/1503.00075v3.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Improved Semantic Representations From Tree-Structured Long Short-Term Memory Networks</a> by Kai Sheng Tai, Richard Socher, and Christopher Manning</p>

<p>And this paper uses CNNs to extract a semantic representation.</p>

<p>2) <a href=""http://nal.co/papers/KalchbrennerBlunsom_EMNLP13"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Recurrent Continuous Translation Models</a> by Nal Kalchbrenner,and  Phil Blunsom. This picture gives a rough idea.<img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/qvcI4.png"" alt=""CSM""></p>

<p><strong>Possible Solution</strong>-<br>
I can map the sentence vector to a fixed number of neurons and then use those neurons to create a tree structure. For example if there is the sentence length is 10 and the max sentence length is 20, I can create a fixed dimensionality layer of 20 neurons and then (in this particular case) the first word to the first 2 neurons, 2nd word to the 3rd and 4th neuron and so on.
Dynamic mapping can be done based on the sentence length.</p>

<p>The weight matrix of the sentence layer to the fixed dimensionality layer will be fixed(the weights should be kept 1). No biases.</p>

<p>But I think there will be some problems in this representation- for example- If this sentence ""I had a lovely icecream and a pastry for dessert."" is mapped to the fixed dimensionality layer it will become ""I I had had a a lovely lovely icecream icecream and and a a pastry pastry for for dessert dessert.."". So that means that shorter sentences will have a more profound effect on the neural network compared to the longer sentences. This biasness towards shorter sentences should also create duplicate words in the output(of a sequence generator). Could someone correct me if I am wrong?</p>

<p>I would welcome more solutions, especially ones that do not remove the relationships that words have between them in a sentence.</p>

<p>I will be implementing this using theano and python. I am considering a layer based approach and using theano.scan to iterate over the layers to finally form the sentence representation.</p>

Assign a short text to one of two categories according to previous assignments (votes),"<p>There is a stream of short texts. Each one has the size of a tweet, or let us just assume they are all tweets.</p>

<p>The user can vote on any tweet. So, each tweet has one of the following three states:</p>

<p>relevant (positive vote)</p>

<p>default (neutral i.e. no vote)</p>

<p>irrelevant (negative vote)</p>

<p>Whenever a new set of tweets come, they will be displayed in a specific order. This order is determined by the votes of the user on all previous tweets. The aim is to assign a score to each new tweet. This score is calculated based on the word similarity or match between the text of this tweet and all the previous tweets voted by the user. In other words, the tweet with the highest score is going to be the one which contains the maximum number of words voted previously positive and the minimum of words voted previously as negative. Also, the new tweets having a high score will trigger a notification to the user as they are considered very relevant.</p>

<p>One last thing, a minimum of semantic consideration (natural language processing) would be great. </p>

<p>I have read about <strong>Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency</strong> and come up with this very simple and basic solution:</p>

<p>Reminder: a high weight in tf–idf is reached by a high word frequency and a low total frequency of the word in the whole collection.</p>

<p>If the user votes positive on a Tweet, all the words of this tweet will receive a positive point (same thing for the negative case). This means that we will have a large set of words where each word has the total number of positive points and negative points.    </p>

<p>If (Tweet score > 0) then this tweet will trigger a notification.</p>

<p>Tweet score = sum of all individual words’ scores of this tweet</p>

<p>word score = word frequency * inverse total frequency</p>

<p>word frequency in all previous votes = ( total <strong>positive</strong> votes for this word - total <strong>negative</strong> votes for this word) / <strong>total</strong> votes for this word</p>

<p>Inverse total frequency = log ( total votes of <strong>all</strong> words / total votes for <strong>this</strong> word)</p>

<p>Is this method enough? I am open to any better methods and any ready API or algorithm.</p>

Calculate distance from densest part of cosine similarity 2d distribution,"<p>Forgive me in advance if my terminology sounds a bit vague, but I am trying to explain my problem in plain English.</p>

<p>Let's say I have 10 sets of documents and for each set I have calculated the cosine similarity matrix based on the term frequency matrix of the set.</p>

<p>In R we can simulate my list of cosine similarity matrices like this</p>

<pre><code>cosine_simil_mat &lt;- list()
for (i in 1:10) {
  cosine_simil_mat[[i]] &lt;-
    matrix(rnorm(n=100, mean=0.89, sd=.2),ncol=10)
}
</code></pre>

<p>Now, for each matrix, I can visualise the distance separating each document on a plane with this</p>

<pre><code>mds &lt;- cmdscale(1-cosine_simil_mat[[1]], eig=TRUE, k=2)
x &lt;- mds$points[,1]
y &lt;- mds$points[,2]
</code></pre>

<p>(note the <code>1-</code> part, since make more sense to visualise the dissimilarities (or distance) not the similarities)</p>

<p>I can plot my <code>mds</code> with </p>

<pre><code>mds_df &lt;-
  data.frame(x,y, type=c(""alpha"", c(rep(""betas"",dim(cosine_simil_mat[[i]])[1]-1)) ) )

require(ggplot2)
ggplot(mds_df, aes(x,y)) +
  geom_point(aes(colour = type)) + geom_density2d() + theme_bw()

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/pL8Br.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/pL8Br.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>Now, what I want to do is to understand how my document of interest (<code>alpha</code>), which is always the first row/column of the cosine similarity matrix, behaves in the different sets. Specifically, I want to measure the distance of my document <code>alpha</code> from the densest part of each plot, in order to understand whether the document <code>alpha</code> is at the core of the sets, measured in terms of relative term frequencies, or at the periphery and if its position change in the different sets. </p>

<p>Does any statistic capture this distance from the densest part of the plot? Does it make any sense?</p>

detect words with the same root,"<p>I am currently developing an automated <strong>Index-Generator</strong> for pdf-files in Java. The concept is pretty simple (right now): I iterate over every word in the pdf, compare with an ignore list (something like the 10000 most common words in that language) and then add it to a <code>com.google.common.collect.HashMultimap</code> with the word as String and a HashSet of pages, the word occurs on.</p>

<p>This is working pretty fine, but still I am getting words in all different <strong>declination/conjugation</strong> forms as separate items in the index. I was thinking of just comparing a relative sub-string of those words, but for instance in the German language (which the program is intended for) with all its irregularities, there is very less benefit of this approach. </p>

<p>Any other ideas, libraries, regex's, whatsoever?
Thanks in advance</p>

What are the methods except Bag Of Words (TF-IDF) for converting textual features into numerical features?,"<p>I have been working on Natural Language Processing these days. My aim is to classify different words in a multi-lingual sentence written in Roman Script based on some criteria. Thus, I need a classifier for it. Unquestionably, there are many. But since my features aren't numerical but textual, and most of the classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM) input numerical features, I looked for some methodology to convert my textual features into numerical one. Though the concept of Bag Of Words with the use of Term Frequency and Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) is a generic approach for this purpose, one of my textual feature, namely local context, is of fixed length and i want to know if it is possible to convert it into numerical feature without using TF-IDF. Local context feature refers to considering previous two and next two words (which comprise the context of a particular word).

Lexical richness as Shannon&#39;s Entropy; Python,"<p>The Entropy formula for lexical richness is </p>

<p><a href=""https://i.sstatic.net/kTJoW.png"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer""><img src=""https://i.sstatic.net/kTJoW.png"" alt=""enter image description here""></a></p>

<p>The probability p-ith is calculated by dividing V-ith by N, where N is the total number of tokens in the text and V-ith is the number of times a specific type occurs (at least that's my understanding). </p>

<p>So, if i have a string <code>the, the, the, a, a, over, love, one, tree</code>
there are 9 <code>tokens</code>, but only 6 <code>types</code>.</p>

<p><code>V-'theth'</code> (from what I understand) would be <code>3</code> and therefore <code>p-'theth'</code> would be calculated as <code>3/9 = 0.33</code>. <code>V-'ath'</code> would then be <code>0.22</code>, and so on. <code>H</code> in this instance would be <code>-100*((0.33*log0.33 + 0.22*log0.22 + 0.11*log0.11 + 0.11*log0.11 + 0.11*log0.11+ 0.11*log0.11)/log9)</code></p>

Getting rare translations from Google Translate request,"<p>For my Bachelors Degree, I am working on a statistical machine translator. Currently, I need a dictionary of English words with all their possible translations. For example:</p>

<pre><code>[EN] Food -&gt; [RO] Mancare
</code></pre>

<p>or</p>

<pre><code>[EN] Food -&gt; [RO] Hrana
</code></pre>

<p>To build the dictionary I need, I adapted a python script (original <a href=""https://github.com/mouuff/Google-Translate-API/blob/master/python/GoogleTranslate.py"" rel=""nofollow"">here</a>) that takes every word from a list of English words and sends it to google translate, then writes the result in a file. However, I only receive one result per word, the most common translation.</p>

<p>How can I receive the uncommon and rare translations? The Google translate website lists other possible translations, but they do not appear in my result. The <a href=""https://translate.google.com/m?hl=ro&amp;sl=en&amp;q=food"" rel=""nofollow"">link used in the script</a> is different from the regular Google Translate. I tried sending the request to the regular Google Translate link, but the return page doesn't contain the information I need.</p>

<p>Alternatively, do you know an already existing English - Romanian dictionary with multiple possible translations per word?</p>

<p>Thank you!</p>

<p>This is my Google Translate script:</p>

<pre><code>    import urllib2

def translate(word, sourceLanguage, targetLanguage):
    agents = {'User-Agent':""Mozilla/4.0 (compatible; MSIE 6.0; Windows NT 5.1; SV1; .NET CLR 1.1.4322; .NET CLR 2.0.50727; .NET CLR 3.0.04506.30)""}
    before_trans = 'class=""t0""&gt;'
    link = ""http://translate.google.com/m?hl=%s&amp;sl=%s&amp;q=%s"" % (targetLanguage, sourceLanguage, word)
    request = urllib2.Request(link, headers=agents)
    page = urllib2.urlopen(request).read()
    result = page[page.find(before_trans)+len(before_trans):]
    result = result.split(""&lt;"")[0]
    return (result,page)

Regex to extract the words from other languages,"<p>I know that I can extract the English letters and numbers by using the <code>A-Za-z0-9</code> regex.</p>

<p>How can I extract the words from other languages such as Arabic and only allow the letters and numbers in their script and nothing else?</p>

<p>One way I have used is to filter out everything I don't want from the text and then I am left with the just words but this approach takes a lot of CPU time and is not efficient on large-scale applications.</p>

<p>Now I was wondering what other methods there were in use or someone knows that can be used to analyse the text of other languages.</p>

<p>How can be words extracted from languages such as Chinese, Japanese, etc which do not even use spaces between words? One approach I took to differentiate between words is to see the styles and line breaks as a method to realise that they must be different works but this approach can be unreliable sometimes when people don't use a lot of line breaks or formatting to separate different words.</p>

<p>So, to sum up, how can other languages can be analysed using regex? </p>

bad tokenization in stanford postagger,"<p>I'm trying to use the Stanford POS tagger to tag some French text. To do that, I use the following command:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cat file.txt | java -mx10000m -cp 'stanford-postagger.jar:'
  edu.stanford.nlp.tagger.maxent.MaxentTagger -model
  models/french.tagger -sentenceDelimiter newline > output.txt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>(There is one sentence per line.)</p>

<p>But I noticed that the tags were pretty bad, and that the real issue actually comes from the French tokenization itself. I think that the tokenization is done by an English tokenizer.</p>

<p>So I tried to only tokenize the text in French by doing this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cat file.txt | java -mx10000m -cp 'stanford-postagger.jar:'
  edu.stanford.nlp.international.french.process.FrenchTokenizer
  -sentenceDelimiter newline > tokenized.txt</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And there the French tokens are good.</p>

Convert natural language into logical formula,"<p>I tried for days to write a NLTK grammar to convert simple French sentences into logical formulas. My problem can be similar with English sentences. My goal is that this grammar accepts several orders (home automation) and converts them into logical formulas. Some examples of orders:</p>

<p>Turn on the light:</p>

<pre><code>exists x.(turn_on(x) &amp; light(x))
</code></pre>

<p>Turn on the green light:</p>

<pre><code>exists x.(turn_on(x) &amp; light(x) &amp; green(x))
</code></pre>

<p>Turn on the light of the kitchen</p>

<pre><code>exists x.(turn_on(x) &amp; light(x) &amp; exists y.(kitchen(y) &amp; in(x, y)))
</code></pre>

<p>In these examples, the word <em>turn_on</em> is not really a logical predicate. It will be used in the next step of my program (when it will convert this formula into another representation).</p>

<p>However, I have many difficulties to write the rule about possession relationship. I would like that the rule accepts an ""infinite"" recursion like:</p>

<ul>
<li>turn on the light of the kitchen (the light belongs to the kitchen in my database)</li>
<li>turn on the light of the kitchen of the house (the kitchen belongs to the house in my database)</li>
<li>turn on the light of the kitchen of the house of [...] (etc.)</li>
</ul>

<p>I succeeded to convert the first sentence but not the others. Here my grammar (I translate French to English for a better understanding):</p>

<pre><code>% start SV

SV[SEM=&lt;?v(?sn)&gt;] -&gt; V[SEM=?v] SN[SEM=?sn]

SN[SEM=&lt;?ap(?sn1, ?sn2)&gt;] -&gt; SN[SEM=?sn1] AP[SEM=?ap] SN[SEM=?sn2]
SN[SEM=&lt;?ad(?n)&gt;]         -&gt; AD[SEM=?ad] N[SEM=?n]
SN[SEM=?n]                -&gt; N[SEM=?n]

N[SEM=&lt;?adj(?n)&gt;] -&gt; ADJ[SEM=?adj] N[SEM=?n]

V[SEM=&lt;\P.P(\x.turn_on(x))&gt;]  -&gt; 'turn' 'on'

N[SEM=&lt;\x.light(x)&gt;]    -&gt; 'light'
N[SEM=&lt;\x.kitchen(x)&gt;]  -&gt; 'kitchen'
N[SEM=&lt;\x.house(x)&gt;]    -&gt; 'house'

ADJ[SEM=&lt;\P x.(P(x) &amp; big(x))&gt;]   -&gt; 'big'
ADJ[SEM=&lt;\P x.(P(x) &amp; green(x))&gt;] -&gt; 'green'

AD[SEM=&lt;\P Q.exists x.(P(x) &amp; Q(x))&gt;]         -&gt; 'the'
AP[SEM=&lt;\P Q R.Q(\x.P(\y.(in(y,x) &amp; R(y))))&gt;] -&gt; 'of'
</code></pre>

<p>With this grammar and the order ""turn on the light of the kitchen"", I get:</p>

<pre><code>exists x.(kitchen(x) &amp; exists z1.(light(z1) &amp; in(z1,x) &amp; turn_on(z1)))
</code></pre>

<p>But, for the order ""turn on the light of the kitchen of the house"":</p>

<pre><code>exists x.(house(x) &amp; exists z5.(kitchen(z5) &amp; exists z2.(light(z2) &amp; in(z2,z5) &amp; in(z2,x) &amp; turn_on(z2))))
</code></pre>

<p>To be more readable, the same formula without the ""exists"":</p>

<pre><code>(house(x4) &amp; kitchen(x6) &amp; light(x7) &amp; in(x7,x6) &amp; in(x7,x4) &amp; turn_on(x7))
</code></pre>

<p>There is a problem with the ""in"" predicates. Indeed, I want that the light is in the kitchen and that the kitchen is in the house. However, in this case, the light is in the kitchen and in the house (yes, it's true, but I don't want that =/). Here's what I would like:</p>

<pre><code>(house(x4) &amp; kitchen(x6) &amp; light(x7) &amp; in(x7,x6) &amp; in(x6,x4) &amp; turn_on(x7))
                                   the difference -----^
</code></pre>

<p>I tried several methods but none of them worked... Can you help me please? I don't know if it's possible with my grammar. My knowledge on logic and lambda calcul are limited, I only just beginning to get interested in these topics.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT:</strong>
Here is the python code that I use for my tests:</p>

As an example: ""I had safe journey"" – assume this is feedback for a driver, provided by a passenger. I need to extract the following information from this sentence:</p>

<pre><code>""I had safe journey"" -&gt; 
 SUBJECT= ""driving""
 SENTIMENT= ""positive""
</code></pre>

<p>I am using NLTK and I referred NLTK Book. I already followed the ""Extracting Information from Text"" section. That section talks about Chunking using a regular-expression based grammar. But I am confused, there are a number of different sentence patterns for the English language and I don't know how to cover all the possibilities.</p>

<p>Actually, I am new to NLP. I also found ""Analyzing Sentence Structure"" and ""Analyzing the Meaning of Sentences"" in the NLTK book. Is chunking enough to achieve  my goal and what am I supposed to do?</p>

Text Tagging in Natural Language Processing,"<p>I have the following project where I need to tag news items with company names to which these news items are relevant to (company names are mentioned in the news items and in many cases, in the headline of the news item). </p>

Algorithm for Determining Word Type using WordNet Database,"<p>I'm working on a project which requires scanning through paragraphs of natural text in English and detecting what type of word they are. The application works with AJAX, PHP, and MySQL.</p>

<p>My application doesn't need to be 100% accurate and simply tries to find the best content that matches text input. To do this I've used an SQL version of the WordNet database which allows me to search for words and their types as so using the <code>dict</code> view.</p>

<pre><code>SELECT lemma, pos FROM dict WHERE lemma = 'fool' ORDER BY lemma;
</code></pre>

<p>The above is an example of what the database sees but my PHP actually creates dynamic bound parameters based on the text from the AJAX calls and in reality, will contain many keywords.</p>

<p>This will return an array of records with each word searched for and their type.</p>

<p>My problem however is that most words can be multiple types, for example, with the fool example, it brings back three as a noun, and four as a verb. The minute differences aren't needed for me but I would like to know if the word is a noun or a verb in it's usage.</p>

<p>This problem persists across most words which means I cannot accurately detect different types of words because it could be any of the uses.</p>

<p>I am wondering if anybody could point me in the right direction of an algorithm or what I may be able to do in order to give at the very least a best guess at what the word type is.</p>

<p>The ones most important to get right are adjectives and nouns.</p>

Debugging Neural Network for (Natural Language) Tagging,"<p>I've been coding a Neural Network for recognizing and tagging parts of speech in English (written in Java). The code itself has no 'errors' or apparent flaws. Nevertheless, it is not learning -- the more I train it does not change its ability to predict the testing data. The following is information about what I've done, please ask me to update this post if I left something important out.</p>

<p>I wrote the neural network and tested it on several different problems to make sure that the network itself worked. I trained it to learn how to double numbers, XOR, cube numbers, and learn the sin function to a decent accuracy. So, I'm fairly confident that the actual algorithm is working.</p>

<p>The network using using the sigmoid activation function. The learning rate is .3, Momentum is .6. The weights are initialized to rng.nextFloat() -.5) * 4</p>

<p>I then got the Brown Corpus data-set and simplified the tagset to 'universal' with NLTK. I used NLTK for generating and saving all the corpus and dictionary data. I cut the last 15,000 sentences out of the corpus for testing purposes. I used the rest of the corpus (about 40,000 sentences of tagged words) for training. </p>

<p>The neural network layout is as follows: There is an input neuron for each Tag. Output Layer: There is one output neuron for each tag. The network is taking inputs for 3 words: first: the word coming before the word we want to tag, second: the word that needs to be tagged, third: the word that follows the second word. So, total number of inputs are 3x(total number of possible tags). The input values are numbers between 0 and 1. Each of the 3 words being fed into the input layer is searched for in a dictionary (made up by the 40,000 corpus, the same corpus that is used for training). The dictionary holds the number of times that each word has been tagged in the corpus as what part of speech. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For instance, the word 'cover' is tagged as a noun 1 time and a verb 3
  times.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Percentages of being tagged are computed for each part of speech that the word is associated as, and this is what is fed into the network for that particular word. So, the input neuron designated as NOUN would receive .33 and VERB would receive .66. The other input neurons that hold tags for that word receive an input of 0.0. This is done for each of the 3 words to be inputted. If a word is the first word of a sentence, the first group of tags are all 0. If a word is the last word of a sentence, the final group of input neurons that hold the tag probabilities for the following word are left as 0s.
I've been using 10 hidden nodes (I've read a number of papers and this seems to be a good place to start testing with)</p>

<p>None of the 15,000 testing sentences were used to make the 'dictionary.' So, when testing the network with this partial corpus there will be some words the network has never seen. Words that are not recognized have their suffix stripped, and their suffix is searched for in another 'dictionary.' Whatever is most probable for that word is then used as inputs for it.</p>

<p>This is my set-up, and I started trying to train the network. I've been training the network with all 40,000 sentences. 1 epoch = 1 forward and backpropagation of every word in each sentence of the 40,000 training-set. So, just doing 1 epoch takes quite a few seconds. Just by knowing the word probabilities the network did pretty well, but the more I train it, nothing happens. The numbers that follow the epochs are the number of correctly tagged words divided by the total number of words.</p>

<p>First run 50 epochs: 0.928218786</p>

<p>100 epochs:        0.933130661</p>

<p>500 epochs:       0.928614499 took around 30 minutes to train this                   </p>

<p>Tried 10 epochs:         0.928953683 </p>

<p>Using only 1 epoch had results that pretty much varied between .92 and .93</p>

<p>So, it doesn't appear to be working...</p>

<p>I then took 55 sentences from the corpus and used the same dictionary that had probabilities for all 40,000 words. For this one, I trained it in the same way I trained my XOR -- I only used those 55 sentences and I only tested the trained network weights on those 55 sentences. The network was able to learn those 55 sentences quite easily. With 120 epochs (taking a couple seconds) the network went from tagging 3768 incorrectly and 56 correctly (on the first few epochs) to tagging 3772 correctly and 52 incorrectly on the 120th epoch. </p>

<p>This is where I'm at, I've been trying to debug this for over a day now, and haven't figured anything out.</p>

<p>Since it should be more phrasebook than dictionary we want to keep the data model / structure first simple.

  <p>For example, to train a new English tagger, start with the left3words
  tagger props file. To train a tagger for a western language other than
  English, you can consider the props files for the German or the French
  taggers, which are included in the full distribution. For languages
  using a different character set, you can start from the Chinese or
  Arabic props files. Or you can use the -genprops option to

Elasticsearch - Nest - Missing First Character,"<p>I am using the Nest client against Elasticsearch. I am using an n-gram index analyzer. I am noticing some odd behavior - when I search for words from the beginning I am not getting any results. However, if I search from the second character on, it works perfectly.

Stanford tokenizer run from command line pipe output to file,"<p>I've looked all over the place to determine if it's possible to just run the Stanford CoreNLP tokenizer component from the command line and pipe the output directly to a file (as one can do with the Stanford Chinese Word Segmenter) and I've not seen any definitive answer so I'm posing it here as a distinct question, is that possible?

<p>This will tell me how many tokens there are, as output to the terminal, but the output.txt file always comes up empty, why is that? Perhaps I can employ some alternative piping strategy?</p>

<p>Ideally what I would like are all the tokens separated onto different lines in an output file. </p>

<p>At this point I'm thinking that I'm going to have to write a small Java program to achieve task, is that the case? </p>

#Not the write answer b/c \w+ matches the ""n""

How to train a Chinese segmenter model by Stanford NLP Tools,"<p>I am new to the Stanford CoreNLP Tools. Now I do not get an excellent segment result in Chinese, so I want to change the granulity of the Segmenter. I thought I could do this by training my own dict. </p>

<p>I downloaded the <a href=""http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/trainSegmenter-20080521.tar.gz"" rel=""nofollow"" title=""trainSegmenter-20080521.tar.gz""><code>trainSegmenter-20080521</code></a> file, and follow the <code>trainSegmenter-20080521/README.txt</code>.</p>

<p>This is the README.txt:</p>

<pre><code>Sat Jun 21 00:57:22 2008
Author: Pi-Chuan Chang

Here's a documentation of how to train and test the segmenter on specific split 
range of the CTB data.

The following steps assumes you have 3 files defining the ranges of train/dev/test.
They should be named as ""ctb6.train"", ""ctb6.dev"", ""ctb6.test"" respectively.
The format should be like:
      chtb_0003.fid
      chtb_0015.fid
      ...

[STEP 1] change the CTB6 path in the Makefile:
      CTB6=/afs/ir/data/linguistic-data/Chinese-Treebank/6/

[STEP 2] download and uncompress the lastest segmenter from:
      http://nlp.stanford.edu/software/stanford-chinese-segmenter-2008-05-21.tar.gz
and change this path in the Makefile to your local path:
      SEGMENTER=/tmp/stanford-chinese-segmenter-2008-05-21/

[STEP 3] simply type:
      make all
You can also split down into these sub-steps:
      make internaldict # make internal dictionaries for affixation feaetures
      make data         # make datasets
      make traintest    # train &amp; test the CRF segmenter
</code></pre>

<p>But I still have some problems:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>What is the format of the training file and what is <code>train/dev/test</code> each for?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <code>chtb_0003.fid</code>, <code>chtb_0015.fid</code> and so on?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the <code>CTB6 path</code> in the Makefile, it seems that I shoud change the variable <code>CTB6</code> into <code>/afs/ir/data/linguistic-data/Chinese-Treebank/6/</code>. But it is aready there and it seems not a valid subpath.</p></li>
</ol>

<p>By the way, there are many properties should be set for special demands, e.g., <code>sighanPostProcessing</code> and <code>serDictionary</code>. </p>

<p>Is there somewhere I can get all of those properties and their explanation?</p>

<p>All I can do now is to read the source code, e.g., <code>edu.stanford.nlp.sequences.SeqClassifierFlags.java</code>, but I still get confused with these property flags.</p>

<p>So appreciated for anyone's help.</p>

Then I go through the text in language A, and using the bigrams I detect these in language A and store them in a file. However, this methods finds many words that are common for both languages, and it also finds strange bigrams like the name of two countries adjacent to each other, and other anomalies. </p>

Maltparser doesn&#39;t do anything,"<p>I'm working with maltparser, nltk for process texts. Well i have a integration between maltparser and nltk that works fine. But since every time i execute the program nltk call java VE this take a lot of time... So i think make a webservice who takes conll .txt and return conll parsed by java app. </p>

<p>Well the problem come when i test examples from maltparser sources. I pick one from just initialize model and parser a array of tokens. I just change de model to the regular english one (engmalt.linear-1.7.mco). So execute and return the sentences just like input.</p>

<p>The code is this</p>

        model = ConcurrentMaltParserService.initializeParserModel(swemaltMiniModelURL);
    } catch (Exception e) {
        e.printStackTrace();
    }

    // Creates an array of tokens, which contains the Swedish sentence 'Samtidigt får du högsta sparränta plus en skattefri sparpremie.'

How to honor/inherit user&#39;s language settings in WinForm app?,"<p><em>I have worked with globalization settings in the past but not within the .NET environment, which is the topic of this question. What I am seeing is most certainly due to knowledge I have yet to learn so I would appreciate illumination on the following.</em></p>

<hr>

<p>Setup:
My default language setting is English (en-us specifically). I added a second language (Danish) on my development system (WinXP) and then opened the language bar so I could select either at will. </p>

<hr>

<p>I selected Danish on the language bar then opened Notepad and found the language reverted to English on the language bar. I understand that the language setting is <em>per application</em>, so it seemed that Notepad set the default back to English. (I found that strange since Windows and thus Notepad is used all over the world.) Closing Notepad returned the setting on the language bar to Danish. I then launched my open custom WinForm application--which I know does not set the language--and it <em>also</em> reverted from English to Danish when opened, then back to Danish when terminated!</p>

<p><strong>Question #1A:</strong> How do I get my WinForm application upon launch to inherit the current setting of the language bar? My experiment seems to indicate that each application starts with the system default and requires the user to manually change it once the app is running--this would seem to be a major inconvenience for anyone that wants to work with more than one language!</p>

<p><strong>Question #1B:</strong> If one must, in fact, set the language manually in a multi-language scenario, how do I change my default system language (e.g. to Danish) so I can test my app's launch in another language?</p>

<hr>

<p>I added a display of the current language in my application for this next experiment. Specifically I set a <code>MouseEnter</code> handler on a label that set its tooltip to <code>CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name</code> so each time I mouse over I thought I should see the current language setting. Since setting the language before I launch my app did not work, I launched it then set the language to Danish. I found that some things (like typing in a TextBox) did honor this Danish setting. But mousing over the instrumented label still showed en-us!</p>

<p><strong>Question #2A:</strong> Why does <code>CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.Name</code> not reflect the change from my language bar while other parts of my app seem to recognize the change? (Trying <code>CultureInfo.CurrentUICulture.Name</code> produced the same result.) </p>

<p><strong>Question #2B:</strong> Is there an event that fires upon changes on the language bar so I could recognize within my app when the language setting changes?</p>

<hr>

<h2>2010.05.13 Update</h2>

<p>The short but sweet information provided by Eric from Microsoft (see his answer below) directly addressed only one of my four questions (#2A) but it provided just the impetus I needed to delve further and figure out the rest. For the benefit of others who may also be befuddled by this, here is what I uncovered:</p>

<p><strong>Answer #1A:</strong> An application inherits the setting of the default input language, <em>not</em> the language you specify on the language bar. Once your application is running, then changes on the language bar <em>will</em> be noticed immediately by your app.</p>

<p><strong>Answer #1B:</strong> Setting the default input language is done via Regional and Language Options control panel >> Languages tab >> Details >> Settings tab >> default input language.</p>

<p><strong>Answer #2A:</strong> Answered by Eric, the current culture is distinct from the current input language that is reflected on the language bar; typing in a text box is influenced only by the current input language.</p>

<p><strong>Answer #2B:</strong> There is no predefined event for either input language or current culture change notification. An important fact to note here is that input language changes are automatically recognized immediately while current culture changes are not. You must restart your application for a current culture change to take effect--unless you can notice the change and act upon it yourself. To that end I found an MSDN article (<a href=""http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/magazine/cc163824.aspx#S1"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">The Many Faces of the CultureInfo Class</a>) that provides just such a hook to notice the change.</p>

Extending the training of the OpenNLP organisation model,"<p>I am new to NLP and the OpenNLP libraries and am playing around at the moment with some of the functionality in particular the library's ability to extract names of organisations. If I use a simple string such as</p>

NLP project on Comment Summarization,"<p>I am planning to do my final year project on <strong>Natural Language Processing</strong> (using NLTK) and my area of interest is <strong>Comment Summarization from Social media websites</strong> such as Facebook. For example, I am trying to do something like this:</p>

<p>Random Facebook comments in a picture :</p>

<ol>
<li>Wow! Beautiful.</li>
<li>Looking really beautiful.</li>
<li>Very pretty, Nice pic.</li>
</ol>

<p>Now, all these comments will get mapped (using a template based comment summarization technique) into something like this:</p>

<p><strong><em>3 people find this picture to be ""beautiful"".</em></strong>   </p>

<p>The ouput will consist of the word <strong><em>""beautiful""</em></strong> since it is more commonly used in the comments than the word <strong><em>""pretty""</em></strong> (and also the fact that Beautiful and pretty are synonyms).In order to accomplish this task, I am going to use approaches like tracking <strong><em>Keyword frequency</em></strong> and <strong><em>Keyword Scores</em></strong> (In this scenario,<em>""Beautiful""</em> and <em>""Pretty""</em> have a very close score). 
<strong><em>Is this the best way to do it?</em></strong></p>

<p>So far with my research, I have been able to come up with the following papers but none of the papers address this kind of comment summarization :</p>

Fast keyword extraction in elasticsearch,"<p>I have large database of annotations of images stored in an elasticsearch database. I want to use this database for keyword extraction. Input is text (typically a newspaper article). My basic idea for an algorithm is to go through each term from the article and use elasticsearch to discover how frequent the term is in the image annotations. Then output terms from articles which are not frequent (in order to prefer names of people or places over common English words).</p>

<p>I don't need something very sophisticated, these keywords are used just as suggestion for user input, but I want something faster then asking N search queries (where N is number of terms in text) to elasticsearch which can be slow on large texts.

Morphology:Tool to get the root word and suffix for a given english word,"<p>I am trying to do morph analysis in POS tagging.</p>

<p>Is there any tool (which I can call from within a python or java script) which returns the Root form and its suffix , when we call it by passing  an English word as parameter.</p>

<p>if I give input:'liked' , I want to get output:like,ed</p>

<p>To get the root form for a given english word, I tried to use porter stemmer and snowball stemmer (inside a python script) but It does not give the valid root word always, since it just strips off the suffix.</p>

<pre><code>from nltk.stem.porter import *
porter_stemmer = PorterStemmer()
print(porter_stemmer.stem(""ladies""))
print(porter_stemmer.stem(""went""))

went
</code></pre>

<p>for example:
I gave input as 'ladies'
but it return 'ladi' as root form , which is not even an English word.</p>

<p>Sometimes stemmers just return the input word as it is.
for example,
I gave input 'went' and these stemmers return 'went' as root form instead of 'go'.</p>

"Graph database vertex/edge inference from a text (i.e. an informal Graph &#39;schema&#39;), using Natural Language Processing (NLP) - does this exist?","<p>Caveat Emptor - I'm neither a linguist nor a Graph theorist, however, I am a [Java] developer wishing to use a Graph database for persistence and the following topic is of interest to me, and I hope to others.</p>

<p>OK, the idea is to have some application or code to:</p>

<ol>
<li>recognise the embedded relationship structures between named entities within a given piece of text</li>
<li>apply or expose these discovered relationships to usage within a Graph database structure.</li>
</ol>

<p>In such a system, the text might essentially form a basic, layman-written graph schema of sorts. To better visualise this, here is some [very], basic text:</p>

<pre><code>Andrew is married to Jane
</code></pre>

<p>Using the <a href=""http://ucrel.lancs.ac.uk/claws/trial.html"" rel=""nofollow"">online CLAWS parts-of-speech tagger (POS)</a>, I'm given the following:</p>

<pre><code>Andrew_NP0 is_VBZ married_AJ0 to_SENT Jane_NP0
</code></pre>

<p>According to '<a href=""http://www.natcorp.ox.ac.uk/docs/c5spec.html"" rel=""nofollow"">The BNC Basic (C5) Tagset</a>' @ Oxford University, NP0='Proper noun', which is a name (as you know) but these NP0-tagged entries would lend themselves to becoming graph vertice instances/nodes (the end user could be further prompted to give these entries an encompassing 'type/description'). The verb(s), 'VBZ' and adjective(s), AJ0, might highlight graph relationships.</p>

<p>Once the end user has confirmed their graph representation, they might export it to <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphML"" rel=""nofollow"">GraphML</a>, for re-import into a graph database such as <a href=""http://thinkaurelius.github.io/titan"" rel=""nofollow"">Titan</a> or <a href=""http://www.neo4j.org"" rel=""nofollow"">Neo4j</a>.</p>

<p>So, the overall idea is to have a tool that allows a layman end user the ability to create Graph-theory-based database structures, using everyday language.</p>

<p>Does such a tool exist already?</p>

<p>Some of my observations above were influenced, in some way, by the following tools (amongst others):</p>

set the secondnumber to 2

Prolog- translating English to C,"<p>We have a relatively simple assignment that I understand in theory but I think I just don't quite understand Prolog's syntax enough to get that into code. Basically, we have a list of English notations that represent operations in C. They're stored as a list when they're passed to our Prolog program. For example:</p>

<pre><code>add 4 to 3
</code></pre>

<p>is </p>

<pre><code>[add, 4, to, 3]
</code></pre>

<p>We need to write a function that takes that list an returns the equivalent. So if I called</p>

<pre><code>english2C([add,4,to,3], C).
C = 4+3
</code></pre>

<p>It would bind C to the result. So the data structure itself would be something like +(4(3)). We have a list of such English notation we have to translate, so it's a finite number. It's not like we have to account for all possibilities. There are also combinations, where they take two operations and combine them (with a comma in between)</p>

<pre><code>english2C([add,3,to,5,',',then,subtract,7], C).
C = 3+5-7
</code></pre>

<p>I'm just somewhat confused as to how to start. I know I can take the very first element of the list and that will always be an operator (+,-,*, etc etc) and then I can just recursively go through the list looking for the operands. The problem there is for things that require order of operations, like ""add 3 to 5 then multiply by 4"", which should be represented as (3+5)*4 but if you just translate it directly you get 3+5*4.</p>

<p>Oh and we have to see if we can get it to run backwards (give it a C statement (3+5) and translate back to english (add 3 to 5)). That part I don't really have an idea for at all.</p>

<p>EDIT: There's a large enough permutations of possible English notations that I can't just pattern match everything. I get the idea that what I need to do is match the first operator with it's corresponding arithmetic symbol then find the operands. For a combinational statement, that would be the first part (so I would have 3+5) and then there would be a comma followed by the next statement. By the way, the combinational statements can be as long as they want, so it's not just two statements and I'm done. </p>

Is functional programming the next step towards natural-language programming?,"<p>This is my very first question so I am a bit nervous about it because I am not sure whether I get the meaning across well enough. Anyhow, here we go....</p>

<p>Whenever new milestones in programming have been reached it seems they always have had one goal in common: to make it easier for programmers, well, to program.</p>

<p>Machine language, opcodes/mnemonics, procedures/functions, structs, classes (OOP) etc. always helped, in their time, to plan, structure and code programs in a more natural,  understandable and better maintainable way.</p>

<p>Of course functional programming is by no means a novelty but it seems that it has experienced a sort of renaissance in recent years. I also believe that FP will get an enormous boost when Microsoft will add F# to their mainstream programming languages.</p>

<p>Returning to my original question, I believe that ultimately programming will be done in a natural language (English) with very few restrictions or rules. The compiler will be part of an AI/NLP system that extracts information from the code or should I say text and transforms it into an intermediate language which the compiler can compile.</p>

<p>So, does FP take programming closer to natural-language programming or is it rather an obstacle and mainstream OOP will lead us faster to natural-language programming?</p>

<p>This question should not be used to discuss the useability or feasability of natural-language programming because only the future will tell. </p>

Is similarity to &quot;natural language&quot; a convincing selling point for a programming language?,"<p>Look, for example at AppleScript (and there are plenty of others, some admittedly quite good) which advertise their use of the natural language metaphor. Code is apparently more readable because it can be/is intended to be constructed in English-like sentences, says they. I'm sure there are people who would like nothing better than to program using only English sentences. However, I have doubts about the viability of a language that takes that paradigm too far (excepting niche cases).</p>

<p>So, after a certain reasonable point, is natural-languaginess a benefit or a misfeature? What if the concept is carried to an extreme -- will code necessarily be more readable? Or might it be unnecessarily long, difficult to work with, and just as capable of producing hilarity on the scale of obfuscated Perl, obfuscated C, and eye-twisting Bash script logorrhea? </p>

<p>I am aware of some specialty cases like ""Inform"" that are almost pure English, but these have a niche that they're not likely to venture out from. I hear and read about how great it would be for code to read more like English sentences, but are there discussions of the possible disadvantages? If everyday language is so clear, simple, clean, lovely, concise, understandable, why did we invent mathematical notation in the first place?</p>

<p>Is it really easier to describe complex instructions <em>accurately and precisely</em> to a machine in natural language, or isn't something closer to mathematical markup a much better choice? Where should that line be drawn? And finally, are you attracted to languages that are touted as resembling English sentences? Should this whole question have just been a one liner:</p>

convert similar sound word parts,"<p>I'm having trouble searching for the right terms here to solve the below problem; I'm sure it's a done thing, I just can't find the right terms to express the problem!</p>

<p>I'm basically trying to create a classifier that will take word comparison outputs (e.g. some outputs from Levenstein distances) and decide whether the words are sufficiently different. An important input would probably be something like a soundex comparison. The trouble I'm having is creating the training set for the algorithm (an SVM in this case). I have a long list of names and I need to mutate them a bit (based on similar sounds within the word).</p>

<p>E.g. <code>John</code> and <code>Jon</code> would be a mutation to make, and I could label this in the test set as being equivalent. <code>John</code> and <code>Johann</code> have sufficiently different sound and letter distance to be considered different.</p>

<p>a) Create a <code>character n-gram model</code> (The value of n is decided based on certain heuristics and computations)</p>

<p>b) Use a machine learning classifier(such as naive bayes) to predict the language of the given text.</p>

<p>Now, the doubt I have is - Is creating a character N-gram model necessary. As in, what disadvantage does a simple bag of words strategy have i.e. if I use all the words possible in the respective language to create a prediction model, what could be the possible cases where it would fail. </p>

<p>The reason why this doubt arose was the fact that any reference document/research paper I've come across states that language identification is a very difficult task. However, just using this strategy of using the words in the language seems to be a simple task. </p>

<p>EDIT: One reason why N-gram should be preferred is to make the model robust even if there are typos as stated <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/21656861/bytes-vs-characters-vs-words-which-granularity-for-n-grams?rq=1"">here</a>. Can anyone point out more?</p>

Parameters for calculating accuracy of part of speech tagger,"<p>I'm a beginner in Natural Language Processing, and I've this basic question about calculating the accuracy of a POS Tagger (tagger is using a corpus):</p>

<p>(Don't confuse the word 'set' below with the mathematical definition of set. I'm just using it as a normal English word to convey some 'group' or 'mapping' )  </p>

<p>There are different metrics of accuracy like Precision/Recall and Confusion matrix. Both of these require the following two things as input parameter:<br>
<strong><em>1.</em></strong> <em>Predicted Result set</em> : After the POS Tagger runs on the input, we have a prediction of tags for the input words. This parameter I understand; it's basically what the tagger generated using the corpus and some statistical techniques. This set is our <em>prediction</em><br>
<strong><em>2.</em></strong> <em>Actual Result set</em> : This set represents what the <em>actual</em> tag of each word is supposed to be. This set is the <em>reality</em>.<br>
<strong>My question is about this second parameter:</strong> How is this set supposed to be ""constructed"". Am I supposed to manually construct a set that maps each input word to the <strong>correct</strong> tag?. By manually, I mean reading the corpus and then finding what the corresponding tag is for each input word.</p>

<p><strong><em>So my question basically is:</em></strong> If there's some code that calculates accuracy of a POS-Tagger, what is the accuracy calculated against? How does this code know what is the correct mapping of words to tags? And if it does know the correct mapping of words to tags then why is <em>this</em> code not being used to do the tagging itself? (I hope the reader understands my confusion here).</p>

<p>I'll give this example:<br>
<strong>Input sentence</strong> : I am a boy.<br>
<strong>Predicted Tags</strong> : I_Pronoun am_Noun a_Article boy_Verb. (simplified names for tags, and obviously the tagging has been done wrong)</p>

<p><strong>Actual tagging should be</strong> : I_Pronoun am_Verb a_Article boy_Noun<br>
<em>I</em> know what the tagging should be, <em>but</em> how does the accuracy calculator code know what the actual tagging should be? Am I supposed manually prepare a mapping of correct tags for each input sentence, and then pass it as a parameter?</p>

<p>Note that I know how the calculation for Precision/Recall works. I'm simply asking: <em>how do I tell it what's the correct tagging set</em> ?</p>

Natural Language Date Parser for JS that supports arbitrary text surrounding e.g. - &quot;Follow up next week&quot;,"<h2>PROBLEM</h2>

<p>Libraries like <a href=""http://sugarjs.com/dates"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">sugar.js</a> can convert natural language date strings such as:

""next week"" but <em>cannot</em> handle strings such as: ""Blah blah blah... Follow up <strong>next week</strong>""</p>

<p>In my application, I need to process a paragraph of notes and detect action items in it.  Siri and Google Calendar are able to do this.</p>

<h2>Potential Solution</h2>

<p>Option 1: Maintain a list of ""Action Verbs"" for each language such as ""Follow Up"", ""Call back"", ""Remind me"" and then grab the natural language date portion after it and pipe it into Sugar.js to get a date back.</p>

<p>I'm not sure if every language will work in this way though... like in all languages will there be  ? or in some languages is the sentence structure be completely different... </p>

<p>Option2: I might be able to get back various supported prefixes from sugar.js locale specific grammars and by semi brute force pass in strings until I find a valid date.</p>

Suggestions for development of command and control kind of Natural Language based system,"<p>Lately, I have developed a keen interest in the speech recognition and natural language processing domain and have been playing around with a few different approaches to build a system which can perform commands based on natural language instructions. </p>

<p>In my study so far, I have come across various NLP tools, but haven't been able to figure out how to utilize them for my purpose.C# is my primary language, and sadly, there is hardly anything available on the dotnet platform for NLP.</p>

<p>In addition to the learning curve, there are various problems with the regular NLP approach as well. Language ambiguity, named entity recognition, sentence boundary detection etc are a few points that add to the complexity. These issues are much more prominent in free form unconstrained language detection and parsing, but for a limited domain, the complexity should be reduced. However, I couldn't really overcome the challenge as most tools have huge static dictionary data or the training process is too complex. </p>

<p>The other major issue is about the conversational approach. Most of the tools do not handle conversational history and have no way to identify the context of the incoming instruction.</p>

<p>I was hoping that some of you guys who have either worked on a similar technology earlier would be able to help me iron out these challenges and point me towards the right direction.</p>

<p>Can you share your experience with various tools, the approaches you took, the roadblocks you faced and how you resolved them during the process. </p>

<p><strong>Update:</strong> Let me also include a brief overview of what I envision. The system would essentially be a just a command executor that understands simple english. So, if I say, ""send an email to john"", it should understand that I want to send an email and now ask me questions to get more information about what should be the subject line and the content. Additionally,  if there are more than one Johns in my address book and may be more than one email address for John, the system should be able to identify that too and ask me for further directions. </p>

<p>For the implementation, I think I need following components:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Speech to text</strong> converter</li>
<li><strong>NLP engine</strong> to parse the text and identify the action and the objects on which the action is to be performed.</li>
<li>An <strong>execution engine</strong> to create and co-ordinate different agents to perform the different types of actions.</li>
</ul>

<p>The challenge lies in making the system extensible to be able to support more such actionable features at a later stage with a little modification.</p>

<p>I think I am fine with Speech to text part and execution part. But the pain point is the NLP engine which can understand the natural language correctly and give me exact action and parameters for it. </p>

<p>I have played around with POS taggers. They do not help much with the compound statements, and it gets a little tricky to establish the relationship between various verbs and nouns detected in the sentence. </p>

<p>Another issue is with maintaining the context of previous actions and include it making sense of the current statement.</p>

How to distinguish bigrams and merge them into one CSV file in R Studio,"<p>Alright so I am trying to have R read sentences, pull out bigrams, and merge all of these bigrams together into one csv.  Right now I have the code to pull out bigrams for one sentence:</p>

<pre><code>sentence=gsub('[[:punct:]]','', sentence)
    sentence=gsub('[[:cntrl:]]','', sentence)
    sentence=gsub('\\d+','', sentence)
    sentence=tolower(sentence)
    words&lt;- strsplit(sentence, ""\\s+"")[[1]]
    New=NULL
    for(i in 1:length(words)-1){ 
      New[i]=paste(words[i],words[i+1])     
  }
New=as.matrix(New)
colnames(New)&lt;-""Bigrams""
</code></pre>

<p>However, I want to be able to import a csv filled with different sentences and have the previous line of code pull out bigrams for each sentence and then merge them together into one csv file. I started writing a code (below) but it is not right.  I would greatly appreciate any help I can get.  Pretty new to natural language processing in R.</p>

<pre><code>library(tm)
library(plyr)
library(stringr)
data&lt;-read.csv(""file.csv"")
sentences=as.vector(data$text)

bigrams&lt;-function(sentences){

bigrams2&lt;-mlply(sentences,function(sentence){

How to convert plural nouns into singular nouns,"<p>In a recent project, I am faced with the task to convert plural nouns into singular forms. I know some POS tagging algortihms and tools that can recognize plural forms of nouns and tag them as 'NNS', but I did not know any algorithm that can cenvert them into singular forms. I have tried stemming, but stemming seems too aggressive to convert the word. It gives something like this:</p>

<pre><code>parties -&gt; parti
</code></pre>

<p>But what I want is:</p>

<pre><code>fish -&gt; fish
classes -&gt; class
parties -&gt; party
goods -&gt; goods
cups -&gt; cup
</code></pre>

<p>This seems to be a difficult problem without a huge dictionary with every English word in it. Is there any mature algortihm that can make it? I am also happy to learn if there is any library that can do this especially libraries in Java. Thanks.</p>

How to translate words in NTLK swadesh corpus regardless of case - python,"<p>I'm new to python and natural language processing, and I'm trying to learn using the nltk book. I'm doing the exercises at the end of Chapter 2, and there is a question I'm stuck on.

<p>Is there a way to make the translator translate words regardless of case? I've been playing around with it, like doing <code>translate.update(dict(de2en.lower))</code> and what not to no avail. I feel like I'm missing something obvious. Could anyone help me?</p>

NLP grammar: fixing a to an?,"<p>Is there a way to check if an <code>a</code> should really be an <code>an</code> in a sentence?</p>

<p>For example, it should indeed fix the following:</p>

<p><code>A apple  =&gt;  An apple</code></p>

<p>But the following is correct:</p>

<p><code>A urologist</code></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In English, the correct choice of a and an depends on the initial
  sound of a word, not on the initial letter, of the word that they
  precede. The letter a should be used before all words beginning with a
  consonant sound except silent h (an honor) and before words beginning
  with vowels that represent combined consonant and vowel sounds
  (university, unit).</p>

How do NLP practioners assign the lamba for a feature in a maxent classifier?,"<p>I am watching the <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LixC4OJcc9E"" rel=""nofollow"">coursera NLP video</a> on maxent classfiers. In the video, Christopher Manning assigns lambdas to features based on how strongly they pick out some class. For instance, Manning says (~2:00) the feature = ""proceeding word is in and word is capitalized"" (ex. in Quebec) is likely to pick out a class location and so is given a positive weight of 1.8 -- but the feature = ""word has an accent"" gets a weight of -.4 because in American english it is more likely to pick out names rather than places. Manning then says (~4:21) that ""perceptron algorithms"" and ""support vector machines"" are sometimes used to pick out the weights of features -- before he goes on to show a maxent model that normalizes the feature weights. However, in his maxent example Manning still uses the lambdas that he just picked out around minute 2 of the video. Where do these lambas come from? Does the nlp practitioner just pick them out from domain knowledge (as Manning does) and then thinker with them until the algorithm comes out with the correct values? Is there a more systematic method? Am I misunderstanding something in what is happening in this video?</p>

reverse-thesaurus api (no compound words),"<p>i am trying to find a way to do a reverse definition-look-up inside a thesaurus or dictionary. there are some API's for dictionaries and thesaurus available, but few have reverse-lookup function, the ones that do are really limited (e.g. don't consider synonyms). </p>

<p>e.g. desire + emotion + not disgust + not hate ====> results in: love</p>

<p>this is for a project in communication studies. where a limited vocabulary of less than 50 words allows for more sophisticated communication and expression (used for beings that can hold only so many words in their brains)</p>

<p>the objective is to condense a number of source words (usually 3-10) into just one new word or phrase (or a short list of candidates). the new word/phrase would have a roughly similar meaning like the 3-10 words its made of. that new target word/phrase is not part of the dictionary of source words, nor will it join the dictionary. </p>

<p>the 3-10 source word can include negated ones (e.g. NOT tall, NOT fast, ...).</p>

<p>so in a way the 50 source words are my legos, and i want to find out what i can build with them. i want to come up with as many combinations and new words as possible (no compound-words)</p>

Automatic case conversion of text,"<p>From a remote datasource I get text nibbles (usually no longer than like 100 chars) which are all upper case. This is mostly natural language but with interspersed acronyms and punctionation (like + and -). What I would like to do is to convert this text into a readable form, that is, make most of it lower case, except for acronyms and properly capitalize nouns and names (this is for german where many more words are capitalized than, say, in english).</p>

How does Remember the Milk&#39;s string matching work?,"<p>I'm interested in developing a similar solution to RTM's Smart Add Feature. </p>

<p>For those who don't know Remember the Milk here's how it works: Adding tasks is done by means of an input box that accepts strings and parses out different parameters like task name, due date, priority, tags, etc. The parameters are usually preceded by special symbols ( ^, #, &amp;, etc. ). RTM also accepts variations like 'Tennis on Wednesday'. </p>

<p>My basic question to you is how would you design a system that is capable of intelligently discerning different parts of a string. Will I have to look into natural language processing?</p>

<p>Thus far I'm using a simple regex expression that looks for special preceding symbols  ( ^, #, &amp;, etc. ) and then parses out the different parts of the string. This gets increasingly difficult with more and more unordered parameters. maybe that stems from my lack of regex expertise.</p>

<p>A similar problem arises when trying to convert different formats of due dates ( '27 May 2008 16:00', '27th May 2008', '16th June 16:00', 'June 16th 12:00', 'today 12:00am', etc) into datetime objects. I'm currently using Python and regular expressions. My method is to basically run through a long list of possible date and time combinations and convert the matching expression with date.strptime. I found this approach to be hard to maintain; lots of false positives, leftover strings etc. You can look at my code here: <a href=""https://gist.github.com/1233786"" rel=""nofollow"">https://gist.github.com/1233786</a>    It's not pretty, you have been warned.</p>

Sharing state between forked worker processes in a high-performance environment,"<p>This is a follow up to my <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20955683/python-multiprocessing-sharing-a-complex-object/"">previous question</a>. As suggested by Tim Peters, using a <code>Manager</code> may not necessarily be the best approach. Unfortunately I've got too much scaffolding code to post a <a href=""http://sscce.org"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">SSCCE</a>. Instead, I'll try to provide a detailed explanation of my problem. Please feel free to browse the entire codebase on <a href=""https://github.com/mbatchkarov/thesisgenerator"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Github</a>, but it's a bit of a mess right now.</p>

<h2>Background</h2>

<p>I am doing research in Natural Language Processing and I'd like to do (something like) dictionary-based smoothing for document classification. The idea to train a classifier to associate words and phrases with a correct answer. For example, documents containing the word <code>socialist</code> are likely to be about politics, and those containing the phrase <code>lava temperature</code> are likely about geology. The system is trained by looking at a <strong>small number</strong> of pre-labelled examples. Because language is so varied, a classifier will never ""know about"" all possible phrases that it might encounter in production. </p>

<p>This is where the dictionary comes in. Suppose we had <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15173225/how-to-calculate-cosine-similarity-given-2-sentence-strings-python/15173821#15173821"">a cheap and easy way</a> of getting synonyms for almost any phrase out there (I'll cite myself because it's poor taste). When the poor classifier is faced with a phrase it doesn't know about, we could look it up in said dictionary and tell the classifier ""Look, you do not know about <code>communism</code>, but it's kinda like <code>socialist</code>, and you know about that!"". If the dictionary is reasonable, the classifier will generally perform better.</p>

<h2>Pseudo code</h2>

<pre><code>data = Load training and testing documents (300MB on disk)
dictionary = Load dictionary (200MB - 2GB on disk) and place into a `dict` for fast look-ups
Repeat 25 times:
    do_work(data, dictionary)

def do_work(data, dictionary)
    X = Select a random sample of data
    Train a classifier on X
    Y = Select a random sample of data
    Using dictionary, classify all documents in Y
    Write results to disk
</code></pre>

<h2>The problem</h2>

<p>The loop above is a perfect candidate for parallelisation. I have been using a Python 2.7  <code>multiprocessing.Pool</code> (through <code>joblib.Parallel</code>, because it’s easy and provides very useful traceback if things go south). All worker processes need read-only access to the dictionary and the document collection. There is no need for the workers to communicate with one another or with the parent process- all they do is spawn, do some magic, write a file and die.</p>

<p>The dictionary needs to support fast random access. I do not know what documents the sample <code>Y</code> will contain, so I cannot easily prune the dictionary and pass just the part of it that is needed to each worker. The dictionary will be queried very often- typical hit counts per run are in the millions.
Currently my code is memory-bound as (I believe) copies of the document collection and dictionary are being made for each worker process. When parsed <code>data</code> and <code>dictionary</code> typically use up several GB of RAM. I’ve tried using <code>multiprocessing.managers.BaseManager</code> to avoid copying the large objects, but that slowed the workers down. </p>

<h2>The question</h2>

<p>What other alternatives are there to speed things up? Things I have thought about include:</p>

<ul>
<li>MongoDB/CouchDB/memcached should handle concurrent access well, but I’m worried about throughput. zeromq was also suggested in a comment to my previous question, haven't had a chance to look into it.</li>
<li>in-memory <code>sqlite</code> databases and database connections cannot be shared across processes, so each worker will need its own connection to an on-disk database. This means a lot of I/O at first and high memory usage as each worker's cache grows.</li>
<li>memory mapping</li>
<li>using threads instead of processes</li>
</ul>

<p><a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/659865/python-multiprocessing-sharing-a-large-read-only-object-between-processes"">This SO question</a> also suggested that many real-world problems that look like they need read-only access to a <code>dict</code> may trigger <code>fork()</code>'s copy-on-write, so it may be impossible to completely avoid making copies of large objects.</p>

<pre><code>t1 = s(np(n(he)), vp( v(went), np(n(home))))
</code></pre>

<p>and I want it to be</p>

<pre><code>t2 = s(np(n(he)), vp( np(n(home)), v(went)))
</code></pre>

<p>according to a rule that represent t1 represent the SVO language and t2 represent the SOV language architecture.</p>

<p>And the rule set should be applicable for complex sentences with adjectives and adverbs.</p>

<pre><code>t1 = s(np(n(he)), vp( v(went), np(adj(his), n(home))))

t2 = s(np(n(he)), vp( np(adj(his), n(home)), v(went)))

Designing an NLP API in Javascript,"<p>I'm working on <a href=""https://github.com/erick-fernandes/nat-js"" rel=""nofollow"">nat-js</a> (a NLP toolkit in Javascript) and I'm planning to extend it to process other languages, like English and Spanish; today it process only Portuguese.</p>

<p>With nat-js, when you need a tokenizer, you write something like this:</p>

<pre><code>var tkz = new nat.tokenizer();

Natural Language to Binary Fact,"<p>I would like to take a set of English sentences and convert those to a set of relations.  e.g.</p>

<p>""A pilot flies an airplane."" would map to something like the following relation:</p>

<pre><code>flies(pilot, airplane)
</code></pre>

<p>""Bob is the father of Alice and Doug."" would map to</p>

<pre><code>father(Bob, Alice)
father(Bob, Doug)

<p>I know that I have seen a python library to do something like this before, but despite all of my searching I haven't been able to find that.  I have never done NLP programing before, so I may be using terms incorrectly.  My apologies.</p>

<p>UPDATE:
This is not an effort to generate Prolog, but to generate binary (and other) facts about a universe of discourse.  These facts could then be inserted into an object-role model, and help to generate a database schema.  The ""flies"" fact above is just to illustrate, and there is no requirement around the syntax of the output.  It just has to be a regular output.</p>

<p>In linguistic terms, I guess I would like to see a verb phrase and two noun phrases to capture a binary fact.  The way those are structured is not as important as being able to discern the structure in an automated manner.</p>

"Extracting related text given a sentence, keywords or topic","<p>Are there any known ways (above and beyond statistical analysis, but not necessarily excluding it as being part of the solution) to relate sentences or concepts to one another using Natural Language Processing. Thus far I've only worked with NLTK and Stanford-NLP to aid in my project, but I am open to alternative open source solutions.</p>

<p>or perhaps  </p>

<pre><code>""George Orwell believes writers enjoy writing to express their creativity, to make a point and for their egos.""

<p>Might yield lines from the essay like</p>

Selecting the most fluent text from a set of possibilities via grammar checking (Python),"<h1>Some background</h1>

<p>I am a literature student at New College of Florida, currently working on an overly ambitious creative project. <strong>The project is geared towards the algorithmic generation of poetry</strong>. It's written in Python. My Python knowledge and Natural Language Processing knowledge come only from teaching myself things through the internet. I've been working with this stuff for about a year, so I'm not helpless, but at various points I've had trouble moving forward in this project. Currently, I am entering the final phases of development, and have hit a little roadblock.</p>

<p><strong>I need to implement some form of grammatical normalization, so that the output doesn't come out as un- conjugated/inflected caveman-speak.</strong> About a month ago some friendly folks on SO <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/8541447/some-nlp-stuff-to-do-with-grammar-tagging-stemming-and-word-sense-disambiguat"">gave me some advice on how I might solve this issue</a> by using an <strong>ngram language modeller</strong>, basically -- but I'm looking for yet other solutions, as it seems that NLTK's NgramModeler is not fit for my needs. (The possibilities of POS tagging were also mentioned, but my text may be too fragmentary and strange for an implementation of such to come easy, given my amateur-ness.)</p>

<h1>Perhaps I need something like AtD, but hopefully less complex</h1>

<p><strong>I think need something that works like <a href=""http://afterthedeadline.com/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">After the Deadline</a></strong> or <a href=""http://queequeg.sourceforge.net/index-e.html"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Queequeg</a>, but neither of these seem exactly right. Queequeg is probably not a good fit -- it was written in 2003 for Unix and I can't get it working on Windows for the life of me (have tried everything). But I like that all it checks for is proper verb conjugation and number agreement.</p>

<p>On the other hand, AtD is much more rigorous, offering more capabilities than I need. But I can't seem to get the <a href=""http://blog.afterthedeadline.com/2009/09/15/python-bindings-for-atd/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">python bindings</a> for it working. (I get 502 errors from the AtD server, which I'm sure are easy to fix, but my application is going to be online, and I'd rather avoid depending on another server. I can't afford to run an AtD server myself, because the number of ""services"" my application is going to require of my web host is already threatening to cause problems in getting this application hosted cheaply.)</p>

<h2>Things I'd like to avoid</h2>

<p><strong>Building Ngram language models myself doesn't seem right for the task.</strong> my application throws a lot of unknown vocabulary, skewing all the results. (Unless I use a corpus that's so large that it runs way too slow for my application -- the application needs to be pretty snappy.)</p>

<p><strong>Strictly checking grammar is neither right for the task.</strong> the grammar doesn't need to be perfect, and the sentences don't have to be any more sensible than the kind of English-like jibberish that you can generate using ngrams. Even if it's jibberish, I just need to enforce verb conjugation, number agreement, and do things like remove extra articles.</p>

<p>In fact, I don't even need any kind of <em>suggestions</em> for corrections. I think all I need is for something to tally up how many errors seem to occur in each sentence in a group of possible sentences, so I can sort by their score and pick the one with the least grammatical issues.</p>

<h1>A simple solution? Scoring fluency by detecting obvious errors</h1>

<p>If a script exists that takes care of all this, I'd be overjoyed (I haven't found one yet). I can write code for what I can't find, of course; I'm looking for advice on how to optimize my approach.</p>

<p>Let's say we have a tiny bit of text already laid out:</p>

<p><code>existing_text = ""The old river""</code></p>

<p>Now let's say my script needs to figure out which inflection of the verb ""to bear"" could come next. I'm open to suggestions about this routine. <strong>But I need help mostly with step #2</strong>, rating fluency by tallying grammatical errors:</p>

<ol>
<li>Use the Verb Conjugation methods in <a href=""http://nodebox.net/code/index.php/Linguistics"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">NodeBox Linguistics</a> to come up with all conjugations of this verb; <code>['bear', 'bears', 'bearing', 'bore', 'borne']</code>.</li>
<li>Iterate over the possibilities, (shallowly) checking the grammar of the string resulting from <code>existing_text + "" "" + possibility</code> (""The old river bear"", ""The old river bears"", etc). Tally the error count for each construction. In this case the only construction to raise an error, seemingly, would be ""The old river bear"".</li>
<li>Wrapping up should be easy... Of the possibilities with the lowest error count, select randomly.</li>

nlp: alternate spelling identification,"<p>Help by editing my question title and tags is greatly appreciated!</p>

<p>Sometimes one participant in my corpus of ""conversations"" will refer to another participant using a nickname, usually an abbreviation or misspelling, but hereafter I'll just say ""nicknames"". Let's say I'm willing to manually tell my software whether or not I think various possible nicknames are in fact nicknames, but I want software to come up with a list of possible matches between the handle's that identify people, and the potential nicknames. How would I go about doing that?</p>

<p>Background on me and then my corpus: I have no experience doing natural language processing but I'm a competent data analyst with R. My data is produced by 70 teams, each forecasting the likelihood of 100 distinct events occurring some time in the future. The result that I have 70 x 100 = 7000 text files, containing the stream of forecasts participants make and the comments they include with their forecasts. I'll paste a very short snip of one of these text files below, this one had to do with whether the Malian government would enter talks with the MNLA:</p>

</blockquote>

<p>My initial thoughts: Obviously I can start by providing the names I'm looking to match things up with... in the above example they would be past_returns and DougL (though there is no use of nicknames in the above). I wouldn't think it'd be that hard to get a computer to guess at minor misspellings (though I wouldn't personally know where to start). I can imagine that other tricks could be used, like assuming that a string is more likely to be a nickname if it is used much much more by one team, than by other teams. A nickname is more likely to refer to someone who spoke recently than someone who spoke long ago, or not at all on regarding this question. And they should be used in sentences in a manner similar to the way the full name/screenname is typically used in the corpus.  But I'm interested to hear about simple approaches, as well as ones that try to consider more sophisticated techniques.</p>

The professors will let us use any computer language we want to use to code the algorithms and programs we will develop during the curriculum.</p>

<p>I used to develop web apps as a side gig for about 3-4 years and I am proficient in Javascript as I wrote software that used node.js at the server end and the browser at the client. I also have some familiarity with postgresql.</p>

<p>My current style of coding (if we can call that a style) is mainly procedural and I use object prototyping as my main way to create/manage objects in my code. I don't have much experience with object oriented language that use the concept of classes to manage the objects. Therefore I am pretty confident my current coding skills are definitely lacking in regards to what is required for me to write efficient code to deal with that stuff.</p>

<p>So my question is this : what would be the best computer language for me to learn in order to be effective in writing algorithms and data structure suited for the above mentionned linguistic areas?</p>

<p>Thanks in advance for your enlightened answers.</p>

Algorithm to combine a grammatically correct phrase from words,"<p>The problem I'm currently facing is as follows. I have a set of words, and want to construct a grammatically correct phrase/sentence out of them, if at all possible. What I have tried so far is:</p>

<ul>
<li>From the reference text corpus calculate an average position of each word in a sentence;</li>
<li>Using this, sort words in set, and separate with space.</li>
</ul>

<p>The problem with this approach is that most of the time it produces bizarre phrases that make no sense. Is there any way to accomplish this, maybe using <a href=""/questions/tagged/nlp"" class=""post-tag"" title=""show questions tagged 'nlp'"" rel=""tag"">nlp</a> techniques (assuming, I'm only working with English)?</p>

Multi-tenancy with GATE,"<p>I am using Gate to implement natural language processing module in my project. In the next step, I want the system support multiple users. Each user has different set of domain words(I put it into gazetteers). As far as I know, gate use a lot of static resource and It is very difficult to create multiple instances of gate. Do any one have any idea to implement multi-tenancy with Gate? </p>

<p>Thank you so much in advance.</p>

<p>PS: Reasons I use gate is because it has jape rule. It would be great if you can introduce other tool, which is easier to customize and also has that kind of rule based grammar.</p>

Transcript dataset for natural language processing,"<p>I've been searching on the web, and found media such as CNN and NPR provide links to access to their transcripts. To obtain them requires writing something like a crawler which is not so convenient. The reason is that I'm trying to use some transcripts of TV show, interview, radio, movie as training data in my natural language processing projects. So I'm wondering whether there's any collection or database freely available on the web so that I can download all of them at once without writing a crawler by myself?</p>

Natural Language Processing Algorithm for mood of an email,"<p>One simple question (but I haven't quite found an obvious answer in the NLP stuff I've been reading, which I'm very new to):</p>

<p>I want to classify emails with a probability along certain dimensions of mood. Is there an NLP package out there specifically dealing with this? Is there an obvious starting point in the literature I start reading at?</p>

<p>For example, if I got a short email something like ""Hi, I'm not very impressed with your last email - you said the order amount would only be $15.95! Regards, Tom"" then it might get 8/10 for Frustration and 0/10 for Happiness.</p>

<p>The actual list of moods isn't so important, but a short list of generally positive vs generally negative moods would be useful.</p>

<p>Thanks in advance!</p>

"perl: strip html tags, manipulate text, and then return html tags to their original positions","<p>I'm using the Html::Strip module to remove all html tags from a file. I want to then manipulate the resulting text (stripped of html) and finally return the html tags to their original positions. </p>

<p>The text manipulation I'm doing requires breaking the text into arrays using split(/ /, $text). I then do some natural language processing of the resulting arrays (including adding <em>new</em> html tags to some key words). Once I'm finished processing the text, I'd like to return the original tags to their places while keeping the text manipulations I've done in the meantime intact.</p>

<p>I would be satisfied if I could simply remove all whitespace from within the original tags (since whitespace within tags is ignored by browsers). That way my NLProcessing could simply ignore words that are tags (contain '&lt;' or '>').</p>

<p>I've tried diving into the guts of Html::Strip (in an effort to modify it to my needs), but I can't understand what the following piece of code does:</p>

<pre><code>  my $stripped = $self-&gt;strip_html( $text );
  if( $self-&gt;decode_entities &amp;&amp; $_html_entities_p ) {
    $stripped = HTML::Entities::decode($stripped);
  }
</code></pre>

<p>Seems like strip_html is a sub, but I can't find that sub anywhere.</p>

<p>Anyway thanks for any and all advice.</p>

<hr>

<p>... the next day...</p>

<p>After a bit of back and forth with @amon, I have come up with a solution that I believe is sufficient for my purposes. amon pushed me in the right direction even though he recommended I not do what I've done anyway, haha. </p>

<p>It is a brutish method, but gets the job done satisfactorily. Gonna leave it here in the off chance that someone else has the same wishes as me and doesn't mind a quick and dirty solution:</p>

<pre><code>my $input = text.html;
my $stripped = $hs-&gt;parse($input);
$hs-&gt;eof;
</code></pre>

<p>so now I have two string variables. One is the html file I want to manipulate, and the other is the same file stripped of html.</p>

<pre><code>my @marks = split(/\s/, $stripped);
@marks = uniq(@marks);
</code></pre>

<p>Now I have a list of all non-HTMLtag-associated words that appear in my file.</p>

<pre><code>$input = HTML::Entities::decode($input);
$input =~ s/\&lt;/ \&lt;/g; 
$input =~ s/\&gt;/\&gt; /g; 
$input =~ s/\n/ \n /g; 
$input =~ s/\r/ \r /g; 
$input =~ s/\t/ \t /g;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've decoded my HTML containing var and have ensured that no word is up against a ""&lt;"", or "">"" or non-space whitespace character.</p>

<pre><code>foreach my $mark(@marks) { $input =~ s/ \Q$mark\E / TAQ\+$mark\TAQ /g; }
$input =~ s/TAQ\+TAQ//g;
</code></pre>

<p>Now I've ""tagged"" each word with a ""+"" and have separated words from non-words with the TAQ delimiter. I can now split on TAQ and ignore any item that does not contain a ""+"" when performing my NLP and text manipulation. Once I'm done, I rejoin and strip all of the ""+"". Follow that with some clever encoding, remove all the extra spaces I inserted, and <em>BAM!</em> I've now got my NLProcessing completed, have manipulated the text, and still have all of my HTML in the right places. </p>

<p>There are a lot of caveats here, and I'm not going to go into all of them. Most problematic is the need to decode and then encode, coupled with the fact that HTML::Strip doesn't always strip all the javascript or invalid HTML. There are ways to work around that, but again I don't have room or time to discuss that here.</p>

<p>Thanks amon for your help, and I welcome any criticism or suggestions. I'm new to this. </p>

Algorithm to determine probable language of a text,"<p>I'm searching for a simple algorithm or an open source library (PHP) allowing to estimate whether a text mainly uses a specific language. I found the <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14765632/what-is-a-relatively-simple-way-to-determine-the-probability-that-a-sentence-is"">following answer</a> relating to Python, which probably leads in the right direction. But something working out-of-the-box for PHP would be a charm.</p>

<p>Of course something like an n-gram estimator wouldn't be too hard to implement, but it requires a reference database as well. </p>

<p>The actual problem to solve is as follows. I run a WordPress blog, which currently is flooded by SPAM. The blog is in German language and virtually all trackback spam is English. My idea is to inmmediately spam all trackbacks seeming to be English. However, I cannot use marker words, because I do not want to spam typos or citations.</p>

<p><strong>My solution:</strong></p>

<p>Using the answers to this question I implemented a solution, which detects German by a simple stopword ratio. Any comment must contain at least 25% German stopwords, if it has a link. So you can still comment something like ""cool article"", which has no stopwords at all, but if you put a link, you should bother to write proper language.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the stopwords from NLTK are incorrect. The list contains words, which do not exist in German. So I used the <a href=""http://snowball.tartarus.org/algorithms/german/stop.txt"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">snowball</a> list. Using the <a href=""http://search.cpan.org/~dankogai/Regexp-Optimizer-0.23/lib/Regexp/Optimizer.pm"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Perl regexp optimizer</a> I condensed the entire list into a single regexp and count the stopwords using preg_match_all(). The whole filter is 25 lines, a third of the Perl code to produce the regexp from the list. Let's see how it performs in the wild.</p>

How to change the word order of phrasal verbs in a POS-tagged corpus file,"<p>I have a POS-tagged parallel corpus text file in which I would like to do word reordering, so that the ""separable phrasal verb particle"" will appear next to the ""verb"" of the phrasal verb ('make up a plan' instead of 'make a plan up') . This used for preprocessing in a statistical machine translation system. Here are some example lines from the POS-tagged text file:</p>

<ol>
<li>you_PRP mean_VBP we_PRP should_MD kick_VB them_PRP out_RP ._. </li>
<li>don_VB &apos;t_NNP take_VB it_PRP off_RP until_IN I_PRP say_VBP so_RB ._.</li>
<li>please_VB help_VB the_DT man_NN out_RP ._.</li>
<li>shut_VBZ it_PRP down_RP !_.</li>
</ol>

<p>I would like to move all the particles (in the examples: out_RP, off_RP, out_RP, down_RP) right next to the closest preceding verb (i.e. the verb that in combination with the particle makes up the phrasal verb). Here's what the lines should looks like after having changed the word order:  </p>

<ol>
<li>you_PRP mean_VBP we_PRP should_MD kick_VB out_RP them_PRP ._. </li>
<li>don_VB &apos;t_NNP take_VB off_RP it_PRP until_IN I_PRP say_VBP so_RB ._.</li>
<li>please_VB help_VB out_RP the_DT man_NN ._.</li>
<li>shut_VBZ down_RP it_PRP !_.</li>
</ol>

<p>So far I've tried using python and regular expressions to sort the problem by using re.findall:</p>

<pre><code>import re 

file=open('first100k.txt').read()
matchline3='\w*_VB.?\s\w*_DT\s\w*_NN\s\w*_RP'
wordorder1=re.findall(matchline3,file)
print wordorder1
</code></pre>

<p>This will find all the phrasal verbs in word order 1(see below), but that's as far as I've got since I can't figure out how to move the particle next to the verb. Any ideas how to solve this problem properly (not necessarily by using python and regex)? I would like to be able to search for all phrasal verbs and move the particles in the following word orders:</p>

Natural Language Processing - Converting Text Features Into Feature Vectors,"<p>So I've been working on a natural language processing project in which I need to classify different styles of writing. Assuming that semantic features from texts have already been extracted for me, I plan to use Weka in Java to train SVM classifiers using these features that can be used to classify other different texts. </p>

<p>The part I'm having trouble on is that to train an SVM, the features must be converted into a feature vector. I'm not sure how you would be able to represent features such as vocabulary richness, n-grams, punctuation, number of paragraphs, and paragraph length as numbers in a vector. If somebody could point in the right direction, that would be greatly appreciated.</p>

<p>Is there any state-of-art method for such problem? I had done some searches on Google Scholar but failed to find a satisfying result. </p>

Natural Language Processing (NLP) with Java,"<p>I'm starting a project in which sentiment analysis is going to take center stage. Specifically, we'll be doing sentiment analysis of Twitter, Facebook, YouTube and other social network data. </p>

<p>I know of OpenNLP from Apache. It appears great but I think it's a little heavyweight for what I want to do in addition to it's dependence on Hadoop and the like. I haven't used it before and I may be wrong in my assessment of it. </p>

<p>I've seen elsewhere on this site about Stanford NLP. I can't seem to get a good starting point with this library; a tutorial sort of. </p>

<p>Also, I've read about Sentiment Anaysis APIs like AlchemyAPI on this site, but I want a solution I'm fully in control of. I just want a library I can bundle with my application. </p>

<p>In a nut shell I'm looking for a solution that is lightweight, and that I can set up in my local PC. Also, a pointer to a good starting point for Stanford NLP or OpenNLP will be appreciated very much.</p>

<p><strong>UPDATE:</strong></p>

<p>I've gone through the UIMA documentation and its support for components like OpenNLP components and other third party components, in addition to its inbuilt text processing capabilities makes it an attractive starting point. It's open architecture makes me feel it's ideal for what I want to achieve. Additional recommendation or advice will still be appreciated very much.</p>

How to compute letter frequency similarity?,"<p>Given this data (relative letter frequency from both languages):</p>

<pre><code>spanish =&gt; 'e' =&gt; 13.72, 'a' =&gt; 11.72, 'o' =&gt; 8.44, 's' =&gt; 7.20, 'n' =&gt; 6.83,

</code></pre>

<p>And then computing the letter frequency for the string ""this is a test"" gives me:</p>

<pre><code>""t""=&gt;21.43, ""s""=&gt;14.29, ""i""=&gt;7.14, ""r""=&gt;7.14, ""y""=&gt;7.14, ""'""=&gt;7.14, ""h""=&gt;7.14, ""e""=&gt;7.14, ""l""=&gt;7.14

<p>So, what would be a good approach for matching the given string letter frequency with a language (and try to detect the language)? I've seen (and have tested) some examples using levenshtein distance, and it seems to work fine until you add more languages.</p>

""esto es una prueba"" gives (shortest distance:) [:spanish, 13] ...

Find basic words and estimate their difficulty,"<p>I'm looking for a possibly simple solution of the following problem:</p>

Determine POS tagging in English based on database files,"<p>I'm a little bit confused how to determine part-of-speech tagging in English. In this case, I assume that one word in English has one type, for example word ""book"" is recognized as NOUN, not as VERB. I want to recognize English sentences based on tenses. For example, ""I sent the book"" is recognized as past tense.</p>

<p>Description:</p>

<p>I have a number of database (*.txt) files: NounList.txt, verbList.txt, adjectiveList.txt, adverbList.txt, conjunctionList.txt, prepositionList.txt, articleList.txt. And if input words are available in the database, I assume that type of those words can be concluded. But, how to begin lookup in the databases? For example, ""I sent the book"": how to begin a search in the databases for every word, ""I"" as Noun, ""sent"" as verb, ""the"" as article, ""book"" as noun? Any better approach than searching every word in every database? I doubt that every databases has unique element.</p>

How to use the pretrained MaltParser parsing models for english,"<p>I am trying to use the pretrained parsing model for English of the MaltParser by following the steps in the following page, but repeatedly getting a null pointer exception.

"Natural language parsing for Arduino, where to start","<p>For a school project I am looking into natural language programming and thinking how the concept may be applied to Arduino.</p>

<p>Think along the lines of a piece of software that would translate sentences like <code>If the analog sensor on pin 9 reads more than 2 Volts, set the duty cycle of the the servo on pin 10 to 70%.</code> or <code>If the digital sensor on pin 4 reads high, light the onboard LED for 5 seconds.</code> into Arduino code. I'm suspecting that doing this for basic Arduino use cases should be straightforward compared to more general applications.</p>

<p>Does such a thing exist for Arduino? Does it exist for any other popular high-level language, like Python or MATLAB? Could anyone recommend resources for an absolute beginner on the topic of natural language processing (more specifically, a non-CS, non-CS-background graduate student who knows his way around Python, C#, MATLAB and, obviously, Arduino)?</p>

Binary Feature Extraction,"<p>I am a beginner in feature extraction for natural language processing purposes.
I want to know how I can use a hashmap to extract features for a text. If each feature is a ""key"" in hashmap and its value is the ""value"" (all the features are binary, 0 or 1), does it mean that I need to have n hashmap (n is the number of words in the text)? Because for each word I need to extract the features.</p>

<p>Am I right?</p>

Does this neural network model exist?,"<p>I'm looking for a neural network model with specific characteristics. This model may not exist...</p>

<p>I need a network which doesn't use ""layers"" as traditional artificial neural networks do. Instead, I want [what I believe to be] a more biological model.</p>

<p>This model will house a large cluster of interconnected neurons, like the image below. A few neurons (at bottom of diagram) will receive input signals, and a cascade effect will cause successive, connected neurons to possibly fire depending on signal strength and connection weight. This is nothing new, but, there are no explicit layers...just more and more distant, indirect connections.</p>

<p>As you can see, I also have the network divided into sections (circles). Each circle represents a semantic domain (a linguistics concept) which is the core information surrounding a concept; essentially a semantic domain is a concept.</p>

<p>Connections between nodes within a section have higher weights than connections between nodes of different sections. So the nodes for ""car"" are more connected to one another than nodes connecting ""English"" to ""car"". Thus, when a neuron in a single section fires (is activated), it is likely that the entire (or most of) the section will also be activated.</p>

<p><strong>All in all, I need output patterns to be used as input for further output, and so on.</strong> A cascade effect is what I am after.</p>

<p>I hope this makes sense. Please ask for clarification where needed.</p>

<p>Are there any suitable models in existence that model what I've described, already?</p>

Word prediction using WordNet,"<p>Lets say I have a text in English and there is a word missing somewhere in it.

<p>I wanted to use ""<em>distinct</em>"" method in <em>List</em> object, but <strong>converting the string into a list</strong> using ""<em>.split</em>"" method raises out of memory error (""java.lang.OutOfMemoryError: Java heap space"" Error).</p>

detect allusions (e.g. very fuzzy matches) in language of inaugural addresses,"<p>I'm trying to develop a Python script to examine every sentence in Barack Obama's second inaugural address and find similar sentences in past inaugurals. I've developed a very crude fuzzy match, and I'm hoping to improve it.</p>

<p>I start by reducing all inaugurals to lists of stopword-free sentences. I then build a frequency index.</p>

<p>Next, I compare each sentence in Obama's 2013 address to each sentence of every other address, and evaluate the similarity like so:</p>

<pre><code>#compare two lemmatized sentences. Assumes stop words already removed. frequencies is dict of frequencies across all inaugural    
def compare(sentA, sentB, frequencies):
    intersect = [x for x in sentA if x in sentB]
    N = [frequencies[x] for x in intersect]
    #calculate sum that weights uncommon words based on frequency inaugurals
    n = sum([10.0 / (x + 1) for x in N])
    #ratio of matches to total words in both sentences. (John Adams and William Harrison both favored loooooong sentences that tend to produce matches by sheer probability.)
    c = float(len(intersect)) / (len(sentA) + len(sentB))
    return (intersect, N, n, c)
</code></pre>

<p>Last, I filter out results based on arbitrary cutoffs for n and c. </p>

<p>It works better than one might think, identifying sentences that share uncommon words in a non-negligible proportion to total words. </p>

<p>For example, it picked up these matches:</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Obama, 2013:</strong>
For history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.</p>

<p><strong>Kennedy, 1961:</strong>
With a good conscience our only sure reward, with history the final judge of our deeds, let us go forth to lead the land we love, asking His blessing and His help, but knowing that here on earth God's work must truly be our own. </p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Obama, 2013</strong>
Through blood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword, we learned that no union founded on the principles of liberty and equality could survive half-slave and half-free.</p>

<p><strong>Lincoln, 1861</strong>
Yet, if God wills that it continue until all the wealth piled by the bondsman's two hundred and fifty years of unrequited toil shall be sunk, and until every drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn with the sword, as was said three thousand years ago, so still it must be said ""the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous altogether.</p>

<hr>

<p><strong>Obama, 2013</strong>
This generation of Americans has been tested by crises that steeled our resolve and proved our resilience</p>

<p><strong>Kennedy, 1961</strong>
Since this country was founded, each generation of Americans has been summoned to give testimony to its national loyalty.</p>

<hr>

<p>But it's very crude.</p>

<p>I don't have the chops for a major machine-learning project, but I do want to apply more theory if possible. I understand bigram searching, but I'm not sure that will work here -- it's not so much exact bigrams we're interested in as general proximity of two words that are shared between quotes. Is there a fuzzy sentence comparison that looks at probability and distribution of words without being too rigid? The nature of allusion is that it's very approximate.</p>

Unsupervised Feature extraction of dishes by building tree structure of ingerdients with Natural Language Processing,"<p>I am building a recommendation system for dishes. Consider a user eating french fries and rates it  a 5. Then I want to give a good rating to all the ingredients that the dish is made of. In the case of french fires the linked words should be ""fried"" ""potato"" ""junk food"" ""salty"" and so on. From the word Tsatsiki I want to extract ""Cucumbers"", ""Yoghurt"" ""Garlic"". From Yoghurt I want to extract Milk product, From Cucumbers vegetable and so on.</p>

<p>What is this problem called in Natural Language Processing and is there a way to address it?</p>

<p>I have no data at all, and I am thinking of building web crawler that analyzes the web for the dish. I would like it to be as little Ad-Hoc as possible and not necessarily in English. Is there a way, maybe in within deep learning to do the thing? I would not only a dish to be linked to the ingredients but also a category: junk food, vegetarian, Italian food and so on.</p>

Are there any ML/NLP works/papers on parsing/solving math word problems?,"<p>As the title says, any pointers are much appreciated.</p>

<p>I am exploring, where do we stand in terms of ML/NLP efforts, in context of solving (to begin with - parsing) Math Word Problems.</p>

<p>We have decent enough softwares in likes of Mathematica which can solve well formulated math equations.</p>

<p>But when it comes to solving math problems expressed in natural languages, I could not find anything substantial.
When I think about how to approach this, I see it as a sort of Machine Translation problem (translating from English to Math-equations), but there is hardly any 'labeled' data for that. Other approach can be semi (or un) sypervised Relation Extraction.</p>

<p>Since these are just random thoughts, I want to start with some existing work/papers in this direction. My otherwise decent googling skills, didn't help much.</p>

How to determine the (natural) language of a document?,"<p>I have a set of documents in two languages: English and German. There is no usable meta information about these documents, a program can look at the content only. Based on that, the program has to decide which of the two languages the document is written in.</p>

For six web pages in German to which I pointed it only one guess was correct. The other guesses were Swedish, English, Danish and French...</p>

<p>A simple approach I came up with is to use a list of stop words. My app already uses such a list for German documents in order to analyze them with Lucene.Net. If my app scans the documents for occurrences of stop words from either language the one with more occurrences would win. A very naive approach, to be sure, but it <em>might</em> be good enough. Unfortunately I don't have the time to become an expert at natural-language processing, although it is an intriguing topic.</p>

picking the most relevant words from a paragraph,"<p>Not sure how to phrase this question properly, but this is what I intend to achieve using the hypothetical scenario outlined below - </p>

<p>A user's email to me has just the SUBJECT and BODY, the subject being the topic of email, and the body being a description of the topic in just one paragraph of max 1000 words. Now I would like to analyse this paragraph (in the BODY) using some computer language (python, maybe), and then come up with a list of most important words from the paragraph with respect to the topic mentioned in the SUBJECT field.</p>

<p>For example, if the topic of email is say iPhone, and the body is something like ""the iPhone redefines user-interface design with super resolution and graphics. it is fully touch enabled and allows users to swipe the screen""</p>

<p>So the result I am looking for is a sort of list with the key terms from the paragraph as related to iPhone. Example - (user-interface, design, resolution, graphics, touch, swipe, screen). </p>

<p>So basically I am looking at picking the most relevant words from the paragraph. I am not sure on what I can use or how to use to achieve this result. Searching on google, I read a little about Natural Language Processing and python and classification etc. I just need a general approach on how to go about this - using what technology/language, which area I have to read on etc..</p>

<p>is totally different once the stopword <code>not</code> is removed changing the meaning of the sentence to its opposite (<code>I am sure what the problem is</code>). If that is the case, is there a set of rules that I am missing on when not to use these stopwords?</p>

Build a dictionary from two sentenced-aligned texts?,"<p>I have a text corpus which is already aligned at sentence level by construction - it is a list of pairs of English strings and their translation in another language. I have about 10 000 strings of 5 - 20 words each and their translations. My goal is to try to build a metric of the quality of the translation - automatically of course, because I'm dealing with languages I know nothing about :)</p>

<p>I'd like to build a dictionary from this list of translations that would give me the (most probable) translation of each word in the source English strings into the other language. I know the dictionary will be far from perfect but I'm hoping I can have something good enough to flag when a word is not consistently translated, for example, if my dictionary says ""Store"" is to be tranlated into French by ""Magasin"" then if I spot some place where ""Store"" is translated as ""Boutique"" I can suspect that something is wrong.</p>

<p>So I'd need to:</p>

<ol>
<li>build a dictionary from my corpus</li>
<li>align the words inside the string/translation pairs</li>
</ol>

<p>Do you have good references on how to do this? Known algorithms? I found many links about text alignment but they seem to be more at the sentence level than at the word level...</p>

List of Natural Language Processing Tools in Regards to Sentiment Analysis - Which one do you recommend,"<p>first up sorry for my not so perfect English... I am from Germany ;) </p>

<p>So, for a research project of mine (Bachelor thesis) I need to analyze the sentiment of tweets about certain companies and brands. For this purpose I will need to script my own program / use some sort of modified open source code (no APIs' - I need to understand what is happening). </p>

<p>Below you will find a list of some of the NLP Applications I found. My Question now is which one and which approach would you recommend? And which one does not require long nights adjusting the code?</p>

<p>For example: When I screen twitter for the music player >iPod&lt; and someone writes: ""It's a terrible day but at least my iPod makes me happy"" or even harder: ""It's a terrible day but at least my iPod makes up for it"" </p>

<p>Which software is smart enough to understand that the focused is on iPod and not the weather? </p>

<p>Also which software is scalable / resource efficient (I want to analyze several tweets and don't want to spend thousands of dollars)? </p>

How to &quot;smartly&quot; translate formulas into form of natural language?,"<p>I am recently working on a project aiming at evaluating whether an android app crashes or not. The evaluation process is:</p>

<ol>
<li>Collect the logs(which record the execution process of an app).</li>
<li>Generate formulas to predict the result (formulas is generated by GP)</li>
<li>Evaluate the logs by formulas</li>
</ol>

<p>Now I can produce formulas, but for convenience for users, I want to translate formulas into form of natural language and tell users why crash happened.(I think it looks like ""inverse natural language processing"".)</p>

<p>To explain the idea more clearly, imagine you got a formula like this:</p>

<pre><code>  155 - count(onKeyDown) &gt;= 148
</code></pre>

<p>It's obvious that if count(onKeyDown) > 7, the result of ""155 - count(onKeyDown) >= 148"" is false, so the log contains more than 7 onKeyDown event would be predicted ""Failed"".</p>

<p>I want to show users that if onKeyDown event appears more than 7 times(155-148=7), this app will crash.</p>

<p>However, the real formula is much more complicated, such as:</p>

<pre><code>(&lt; !( ( SUM( {Att[17]}, Event[5]) &lt;= MAX( {Att[7]}, Att[0] &gt;= Att[11]) OR SUM( {Att[17]}, Event[5]) &gt; MIN( {Att[12]}, 734 &gt; Att[19]) ) OR count(Event[5]) != 1 ) &gt; (&lt; count(Att[4] = Att[3]) &gt;= count(702 != Att[8]) + 348 / SUM( {Att[13]}, 641 &lt; Att[12]) mod 587 - SUM( {Att[13]}, Att[10] &lt; Att[15]) mod MAX( {Att[13]}, Event[2]) + 384 &gt; count(Event[10]) != 1))

Using NLP to switch genders,"<p>Basically I am writing a Java module that is supposed to take English text and switch the genders of the pronouns.  So for example, if you give it ""She put the box on the table"" it would give you back ""He put the box on the table.""  If you gave it ""His feet hurt"" it would give you back ""Her feet hurt.""</p>

<p>This is pretty much easy, except for the word ""hers.""  Sometimes his = her, sometimes his = hers.</p>

<p>I've been looking into NLP, which I know pretty much nothing about, and I tried out OpenNLP but it's failing me (I can't use the Standford NLP because of the licensing issue).  The POS tagger and the Chunker get confused with her/hers, and so even does the parser.  So for example:</p>

<p>The box was his.</p>

<pre><code>(TOP (S (NP (DT The) (NN box)) (VP (VBD was) (NP (PRP$ his))) (. .)))
</code></pre>

<p>The box was hers.</p>

<pre><code>(TOP (S (NP (DT The) (NN box)) (VP (VBD was) (ADJP (JJ hers))) (. .)))

Understanding Brown tags,"<p>I was reading about linguistics in relation to Natural Language Processing, but the Brown tags are confusing me.</p>

<li><p>WPO (objective wh-pronoun: whom, which, that)</p></li>
<li><p>WPS (nominative wh-pronoun: who, which, that)</p></li>

extracting English verbs from a given text,"<p>I need to extract all English verbs from a given text and I was wondering how I could do it...
At first glance, my idea is to use regular expressions because all English verb tenses follow patterns but maybe there is another way to do it. What I've thought is simply:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a pattern for every verb tense. I have to distinguish between regular verbs (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_verbs) and irregular verbs (http://www.chompchomp.com/rules/irregularrules01.htm) in some way.</li>
<li>Iterate over these patterns and split the text using them (the last word of each substring is supposed to be the verb that gives complete meaning to the sentence, which I need for other purposes -> nominalization)</li>
</ol>

<p>What do you think? I guess this isn't an efficient way to do it but I can't imagine another one.</p>

<p>Thank you in advance!</p>

<p>PS: </p>

<ol>
<li>I have two dictionaries, one for all English Verbs and the other one for all English nouns</li>
<li>The main problem of all this is that the project consists on verb nominalization (is just a uni project), so all the ""effort"" is supposed to be focused in this part, nominalization. In concrete, I follow this model: acl.ldc.upenn.edu/P/P00/P00-1037.pdf). The project consists on given a text, find all the verbs in that text and propose multiple nominalizations for each verb. So the first step (finding verbs), should be as simple as possible... but I can't use any parser, it's not allowed</li>

How to build a 4language dictionary from bilingual dictionaries,"<p>3 days ago I asked a question about building a parallel dictionary which has 3 languages: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11135928/removing-differencies-of-some-text-pairs"">removing differencies of some text pairs</a></p>

<p>The question was as follows:
 I have 2 pair of files by the following characteristics: pair1: (File1.txt , File2.txt) pair2: (File3.txt , File4.txt)</p>

<p>There is a line by line correspondence between each files in these pairs. say that File1.txt and File3.txt are some English words, and File2.txt and File4.txt are their Arabic and French translations respectively. In addition, File1.txt and File3.txt are very similar (and in some cases the same).</p>

<pre><code>
    File1.txt       File2.txt
    EnWord1         ArTrans1
    EnWord2         ArTrans2
    EnWord3         ArTrans3
    Enword4         ArTrans4

    File3.txt       File4.txt
    EnWord1         FrTrans1
    EnWord3         FrTrans3
    Enword4         FrTrans4
    Enword5         FrTrans5
</code></pre>

<p>What I wanted to do then, was to compare English sides of the pairs, find the common words that appear in both files (EnWord1,EnWord3, and EnWord4) and filter out their corresponding translations.
In short, I can say that using two bilingual English-Arabic and English French dictionaries, I am trying to build a 3-lingual English-Arabic-French dictionary.</p>

<p>Steve answered me and wrote a nice code to find duplicated English words and remove others and their translations: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/a/11141345/1265960"">The answer could be found here</a></p>

<p>But I still have a bit more complicated question:
What should I do, if I want to add another language? I mean that I have another English-Russian dictionary (Say File5.txt contains English entities, and File6.txt contains Russian entities) and I want to build a 4-language dictionary instead of a 3-language one.</p>

<p>one way is to build a 3-language dictionary using the current code, and then by rerunning it on a new language pair, build a 4-language dictionary. but I think it is not efficient enough, and it would be better solution to this problem. It also may bring in some inconsistencies in other languages.
My main challenge is checking the duplications: when have just 2 language pairs, it would be very easy to check the duplications. But what should I do if I want to check the duplications in 3 pairs?
How can I change the code to be able to extract 4language dictionary in just one pass?</p>

"Translation of Single Words, Taking into Account Context, using Computer Language Processing Tools","<p>I would like to automatically annotate texts for learners of foreign languages with translations of difficult words.</p>

<p>For instance, if the original text is:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>El gato esta en la casa de mis vecinos</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Becomes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>El gato esta en la casa de mis <strong>vecinos</strong> (<em>neighbours</em>)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The first step is to identify which words are the difficult ones. This could be done by lemmatization of the words in the original text and comparing them with a list of 'easy words' (a basic vocabulary of 1500-2000 words). Those not found in this list will be designated as 'hard words.' This process seems straightforward enough using the Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) for Python.</p>

<p>There is some difficulty in words that must be translated as a pair, such as 'newly weds,' or phrasal verbs 'he <strong>called</strong> me <strong>up</strong>' or the German 'er <strong>ruft</strong> mich <strong>an</strong>' (anrufen). Here words can't be treated individually. For phrasal verbs and the like perhaps some understanding of grammer is needed.</p>

<p>The second step involves obtaining a correct translation of the difficult words according to context in which they appear. As I understand, this is effectively applying the first half of a statistical machine translation system like google translate. I believe this problem could solved using the Google Translate Research API, that lets you send text to be translated, and the response includes information about which word in the translation corresponds to which word in the original text. So you could feed in the whole sentence and then fish out the word you wanted from the response. You have to apply to use this API however, and they have usage limits, which would likely be a problem for my application. I would rather find another solution. I expect no solution will give 100% correct translations and they will have to be checked by hand, but this should still speed things up.</p>

<p>Thanks for your comments.</p>

What methods are used for recognizing language a text is written in?,"<p>If I have a given text (both long or short), with which methods do you usually detect which language it is written in?</p>

<p>It is clear that:</p>

<ul>
<li>You need a training corpus to train the models you use (e.g. neural networks, if used)</li>
</ul>

<p>Easiest thing coming to my mind is:</p>

<ul>
<li>Check characters used in the text (e.g. hiragana are only used in Japanese, Umlauts probably only in European languages, ç in French, Turkish, …)</li>
<li>Increase the check to two or three letter pairs to find specific combinations of a language</li>
<li>Lookup a dictionary to check which words occur in which language (probably only without stemming, as stemming depends on the language)</li>
</ul>

<p>But I guess there are better ways to go. I am not searching for existing projects (those questions have already been answered), but for methods like Hidden-Markov-Models, Neural Networks, … whatever may be used for this task.</p>

Speech Recognition: detecting Japanese Kana (consonant + vowel),"<p>I would like to find some open source code (although I would settle for a closed source product)  to convert an incoming audio stream of Japanese Kana (ie consonant+vowel pairs) and print them out pretty much in real-time.</p>

<p>However, I want to use these basic sound units for my own custom purpose, so I don't want any high-level processing that tries to extract genuine Japanese words. I just want to get the raw Kana.</p>

<p>Is anyone aware of such a technology?</p>

<p>I just learned today that the Japanese ' alphabet ' is basically a 10x5 grid of <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kana"" rel=""nofollow"">Kana</a>.  10 columns ( empty + 9 consonants ) and 5 rows ( vowels )</p>

<p>and each element is called a 'Kana', and the language consists of sequences of these Kana; these are the basic building blocks.</p>

<p>This must surely have a large impact on speech recognition algorithms.</p>

<p>For Western languages, all commercial speech recognition engines I am aware of derive from <a href=""http://cmusphinx.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow"">CMUSphinx</a> which operates on a tri-gram model:  it represents each movement between three phonemes with a unique MFCC vector and figures out the most likely tri-gram sequence(s) for an utterance (from which it can deduce trivially the phonemes, and then run through its dictionary of WORD-triplets, to figure out the most likely sentence).</p>

<p>But for a language such as Japanese, I would guess that this may no longer be the most efficient algorithm.</p>

<p>Instead, it may make sense to try and catch each individual Kana,  or Kana-pair.</p>

<p>...which is going to be 2-gram or 4-gram. but not 3!</p>

<p>Is there anything out there? Or do they just use the same engines the Western world does?</p>

Compose synthetic English phrase that would contain 160 bits of recoverable information,"<p>I have 160 bits of random data.</p>

<p>Just for fun, I want to generate pseudo-English phrase to ""store"" this information in. I want to be able to recover this information from the phrase. </p>

<p><strong><em>Note:</strong> This is not a security question, I don't care if someone else will be able to recover the information or even detect that it is there or not.</em></p>

<p>Criteria for better phrases, from most important to the least: </p>

<ul>
<li>Short</li>
<li>Unique</li>
<li>Natural-looking</li>
</ul>

<p>The current approach, suggested <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4683551/generating-a-pseudo-natural-phrase-from-a-big-integer-in-a-reversible-way/4684842#4684842"">here</a>:</p>

<p>Take three lists of 1024 nouns, verbs and adjectives each (picking most popular ones). Generate a phrase by the following pattern, reading 20 bits for each word:</p>

<pre>
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb.
</pre>

<p>Now, this seems to be a good approach, but the phrase is a bit too long and a bit too dull.</p>

<p>I have found a corpus of words <a href=""http://wordlist.sourceforge.net/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here</a> (Part of Speech Database).</p>

<p>After some ad-hoc filtering, I calculated that this corpus contains, approximately</p>

<ul>
<li>50690 usable adjectives</li>
<li>123585 nouns</li>
<li>15301 verbs</li>
<li>13010 adverbs (not included in pattern, but mentioned in answers)</li>
</ul>

<p>This allows me to use up to</p>

<ul>
<li>16 bits per adjective (actually 16.9, but I can't figure how to use fractional bits)</li>
<li>15 bits per noun</li>
<li>13 bits per verb</li>
<li>13 bits per adverb</li>
</ul>

<p>For noun-verb-adjective-verb pattern this gives 57 bits per ""sentence"" in phrase. This means that, if I'll use all words I can get from this corpus, I can generate three sentences instead of four (160 / 57 ≈ 2.8).</p>

<pre>
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb,
Noun verb adjective verb.
</pre>

<p>Still a bit too long and dull.</p>

<p>Any hints how can I improve it?</p>

<p>What I see that I can try:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Try to compress my data somehow before encoding. But since the data is completely random, only some phrases would be shorter (and, I guess, not by much).</p></li>
<li><p>Improve phrase pattern, so it would look better.</p></li>
<li><p>Use several patterns, using the first word in phrase to somehow indicate for future decoding which pattern was used. (For example, use the last letter or even the length of the word.) Pick pattern according to the first bytes of the data.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>...I'm not that good with English to come up with better phrase patterns. Any suggestions?</p>

<ul>
<li>Use more linguistics in the pattern. Different tenses etc. </li>
</ul>

<p>...I guess, I would need much better word corpus than I have now for that. Any hints where can I get a suitable one?</p>

Natural language grammar and user-entered names,"<p>Some languages, particularly Slavic languages, change the endings of people's names according to the grammatical context. (For those of you who know grammar or studied languages that do this to words, such as German or Russian, and to help with search keywords, I'm talking about noun declension.)</p>

<p>This is probably easiest with a set of examples (in Polish, to save the whole different-alphabet problem):</p>

<ol>
<li>Dorothy saw the cat — <em>Dorota zobaczyła kota</em></li>
<li>The cat saw Dorothy — <em>Kot zobaczył Dorotę</em></li>
<li>It is Dorothy’s cat — <em>To jest kot Doroty</em></li>
<li>I gave the cat to Dorothy — <em>Dałam kota Dorotie</em></li>
<li>I went for a walk with Dorothy — <em>Poszłam na spacer z Dorotą</em></li>
<li>“Hello, Dorothy!” — <em>“Witam, Doroto!”</em></li>
</ol>

<p>Now, if, in these examples, the name here were to be user-entered, that introduces a world of grammar nightmares. Importantly, if I went for Katie (<em>Kasia</em>), the <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Polish/Feminine_noun_declension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">examples are not directly comparable</a> — 3 and 4 are both <em>Kasi</em>, rather than <em>*Kasy</em> and <em>*Kasie</em> — and male names will be <a href=""http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/Polish/Masculine_noun_declension"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">wholly different again</a>.</p>

<p>I'm guessing someone has dealt with this situation before, but my Google-fu appears to be weak today. I can find a lot of links about natural-language processing, but I don'think that's quite what I want. To be clear: I'm only ever gonna have one user-entered name per user and I'm gonna need to decline them into known configurations — I'll have a localised text that will have placeholders something like <code>{name nominative}</code> and <code>{name dative}</code>, for the sake of argument. I really don't want to have to do lexical analysis of text to work stuff out, I'll only ever need to decline that one user-entered name.</p>

<p>Anyone have any recommendations on how to do this, or do I need to start calling round localisation agencies  ;o)</p>

<p>Basically, I have a limited number of prefixes, which can be either one or two letters; a word can have more than one prefix. I also have a limited number of suffixes of one or two letters. Whatever's in between them should be the ""root"" of the word. Many words will have more the one possible parsing, so I want to input a word and get back a list of possible parses in the form of a tuple (prefix,root,suffix).</p>

<p>I can't figure out how to structure the code though. I pasted an example of one way I tried (using some dummy English data to make it more understandable), but it's clearly not right. For one thing it's really ugly and redundant, so I'm sure there's a better way to do it. For another, it doesn't work with words that have more than one prefix or suffix, or both prefix(es) and suffix(es).</p>

<p>Any thoughts?</p>

Building a lemmatizer: speed optimization,"<p>I am building a lemmatizer in python. As I need it to run in realtime/process fairly large amount of data the processing speed
is of the essence. 
Data: I have all possible suffixes that are linked to all wordtypes that they can be combined with. Additionally I have lemmaforms that are linked to both their wordtype(s) and lemma(s). The program takes a word as input and outputs its lemma.
word = lemmafrom + suffix</p>

<p>For example (Note: although the example is given in English I am not building a lemmatizer for English):</p>

<p>word:  forbidding</p>

<p>lemmaform: forbidd</p>

<p>suffix: ing</p>

<p>lemma: forbid</p>

<p>My solution:</p>

<p>I have converted the data to (nested) dicts:</p>

<pre><code>suffixdict : {suffix1:[type1,type2, ... , type(n)], suffix2:[type1,type2, ... ,
type(n)]}    
lemmaformdict : {lemmaform:{type1:lemma}}
</code></pre>

<p>1) Find all possible suffixes and word types that they are linked to.
If the longest possible suffix is 3 characters long, the program tries to match 'ing', 'ng', 'n' to the keys in 
suffixdict. If the key exists it returns a value (a set of wordtypes).</p>

<p>2) For each matching suffix search the lemmaform from the dict.
If lemmaform exists it returns the wordtypes.</p>

<p>3) Finally, the program tries to intersect the wordtypes produced in steps 1) ans 2) and if the intersection is
sucessful it returns the lemma of the word.</p>

<p>My question: could there be a better solution to my problem from the prespective of speed? (Disregarding the option to keep frequent words and lemmas in the dictionary) 
Help much appriciated.</p>

Using Sentiment Analysis to Detect Contradictory Arguments?,"<p>I don't have much background in sentiment analysis or natural language processing at all, but I have been reading a bit about it in my spare time.  I would like to conduct and experiment to analyze forum threads/comments such as reddit, digg, blogs, etc.  I'm particularity interested in doing something like counting the number of for, against, and neutral comments for threads of heated religious and political debates.  Here's what I am thinking.</p>

<p>1) Find a thread that the original poster has defined a touchy political or religious topic.</p>

<p>2) For each comment categorize it as supporting the original poster or otherwise taking a contradicting or neutral stance.  </p>

<p>3) Compare various mediums with the numbers of for or against arguments to determine what platforms are good ""debate platforms"" (i.e. balanced argument counts).</p>

<p>One big problem that I'm anticipating is that heated topics will invoke strong reactions from both supporting and contradicting parties so a simple happy/sad sentiment analysis won't cut it.

Automatic negation of words,"<p>Consider the following statements</p>

<pre><code>We are not talking about a well established company in the NASDAQ
I will not initiate any trades until those clowns hammer out a deal
</code></pre>

<p>I am writing a simple Naive Bayes classifier, basically marking a training set of statements by hand (as either positive or negative sentiment) and storing the words that make up the statement accordingly.</p>

<p>Problem: if I mark both of these statements as having a negative sentiment, the words ""well"", ""established"" (statement 1) and ""any"", ""until"" (statement 2) would be indivudually marked as negatives. Whereas in another case (i.e., ""This company is performing well""), the same words (""well"" in this case) would be marked as a positive, making the sum of sentiment for ""well"" -1 + 1 = 0. I would overcome this by tagging these words as negated words, for example:</p>

<pre><code>We are talking about a not-well not-established company in the NASDAY.
I will initiate not-anymore trades not-until those clowns hammer out a deal
</code></pre>

<p>Is there a standard or best way of tagging these kinds of words (I don't even know if they are of a same group of words)? Obviously, tagging ""company"" wouldn't make sense ""not-company"" doesn't hold any sentimental value. I have (in PHP) made a function that would tag all words after the negation word (not, no, couldn't, etc) but many of them didn't make real sense afterwards (such as ""not-company"", ""not-NASDAQ"", ""not-clowns"").</p>

<p>Since English is not my mother language, I'm asking you if there's a common name for the words I have marked here and if what I want is (rudimentary) possible. I am aware that there are a lot of exceptions possible (double negations etc.) but I do not want to go into that; I believe if this would be possible, it would cover a lot of ground.</p>

Clean and natural scripting functionality without parsing,"<p>I'm experimenting with creating a semi-natural scripting language, mostly for my own learning purposes, and for fun. The catch is that it needs to be in native C#, no parsing or lexical analysis on my part, so whatever I do needs to be able to be done through normal syntactical sugar.</p>

<p>I want it to read somewhat like a sentence would, so that it is easy to read and learn, especially for those that aren't especially fluent with programming, but I also want the full functionality of native code available to the user.</p>

<p>For example, in the perfect world it would look like a natural language (English in this case):</p>

<pre><code>When an enemy is within 10 units of player, the enemy attacks the player
</code></pre>

<p>In C#, allowing a sentence like this to actually do what the scripter intends would almost certainly require that this be a string that is run through a parser and lexical analyzer. My goal isn't that I have something this natural, and I don't want the scripter to be using strings to script. I want the scripter to have full access to C#, and have things like syntax highlighting, intellisense, debugging in IDE, etc. So what I'm trying to get it something that reads easily, but is in native C#. A couple of the major hurdles that I don't see a way to overcome is getting rid of periods <code>.</code>, commas <code>,</code>, and parentheses for empty methods <code>()</code>. For example, something like this is feasible but doesn't read very cleanly:</p>

<pre><code>// C#
When(Enemy.Condition(Conditions.isWithinDistance(Enemy, Player, 10))), Event(Attack(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>Using a language like Scala you can actually get much closer, because periods and parentheses can be replaced by a single whitespace in many cases. For example, you could take the above statement and make it look something like this in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>// Scala
When(Enemy is WithinDistance(Player, 10)) =&gt; Then(Attack From(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>This above code would actually compile assuming you setup your engine to handle it, in fact you might be able to coax further parentheses and commas out of this. Without the syntactical sugar in the above example it would be more like this, in Scala:</p>

<pre><code>// Scala (without syntactical sugar)
When(Enemy.is(WithinDistance(Player, 10)) =&gt; Then(Attack().From(Enemy, Player))
</code></pre>

<p>The bottom line is I want to get as close as possible to something like the first scala example using native C#. It may be that there is really nothing I can do, but I'm willing to try any tricks that may be possible to make it read more natural, and get the periods, parentheses, and commas out of there (except when they make sense even in natural language).</p>

<p>I'm not as experienced with C# as other languages, so I might not know about some syntax tricks that are available, like macros in C++. Not that macros would actually be a good solution, they would probably cause more problems then they would solve, and would be a debugging nightmare, but you get where I'm going with this, at least in C++ it would be feasible. Is what I'm wanting even possible in C#?</p>

<p>Here's an example, using LINQ and Lambda expressions you can sometimes get the same amount of work done with fewer lines, less symbols, and code the reads closer to English. For example, here's an example of three collisions that happen between pairs of objects with IDs, we want to gather all collisions with the object that has ID 5, then sort those collisions by the ""first"" ID in the pair, and then output the pairs. Here is how you would do this without LINQ and/or Lambra expressions:</p>

<pre><code>struct CollisionPair : IComparable, IComparer
{
    public int first;
    public int second;

    // Since we're sorting we'll need to write our own Comparer

        CollisionPair pairOne = (CollisionPair)one;
        CollisionPair pairTwo = (CollisionPair)two;

        if (pairOne.first &lt; pairTwo.first)
            return -1;
        else if (pairTwo.first &lt; pairOne.first)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }

    // ...and our own compable
    int IComparable.CompareTo( object two )
    {
        CollisionPair pairTwo = (CollisionPair)two;

        if (this.first &lt; pairTwo.first)
            return -1;
        else if (pairTwo.first &lt; this.first)
            return 1;
        else
            return 0;
    }
}

{

    {
        new CollisionPair { first = 1, second = 5 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 2, second = 3 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 5, second = 4 }
    };

    // In a script this would be all the code you needed, everything above
    // would be part of the game engine   
    List&lt;CollisionPair&gt; sortedCollisionsWithFive = new List&lt;CollisionPair&gt;();
    foreach (CollisionPair c in collisions)
    {

<p>And now the same example with LINQ and Lambda. Notice in this example we don't have to both with making <code>CollisionPair</code> both <code>IComparable</code> and <code>IComparer</code>, and don't have to implement to the <code>Compare</code> and <code>CompareTo</code> methods:</p>

<pre><code>struct CollisionPair
{
    public int first;
    public int second;
}

static void Main( string[] args )
{           
    List&lt;CollisionPair&gt; collisions = new List&lt;CollisionPair&gt;
    {
        new CollisionPair { first = 1, second = 5 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 2, second = 3 },
        new CollisionPair { first = 5, second = 4 }
    };

    // In a script this would be all the code you needed, everything above
    // would be part of the game engine
    (from c in collisions 
    where ( c.first == 5 || c.second == 5 )
    orderby c.first select c).ForEach(c =&gt;
        Console.WriteLine(""Collision between "" + c.first +
                          "" and "" + c.second));
}
</code></pre>

<p>In the end we're left with a LINQ and Lambda expression that read closer to natural language, and are much less code for both a game engine and for the script. These kinds of changes are really what I'm looking for, but obviously LINQ and Lambda are both limited to specific syntax, not something as generic as I would like in the end.</p>

Tree traversing or what?,"<p>In Python, I'm writing a Natural Language Processing module and can't work out how to code a function to do the following.
Input: a list of parts of speech (POS) derived from an inputted sentence as short strings. Some items in the list are themselves lists because that part of the program doesn't know which part of speech to choose out of two or more possibles.
e.g. a particular six word sentence results in <code>[""DET"", ""NOUN"", [""VERB"", ""NOUN""], ""CONJ"", [""ADJ"", ""ADV"", ""NOUN""], ""ADV""]</code>
i.e the first word is definitely a DET
the 2nd word is definitely a NOUN
the 3rd word could be a VERB or a NOUN
the 4th word is definitely a CONJ
the 5th word could be a ADJ, ADV or NOUN
the 6th word is definitely a ADV.</p>

<p>So INPUT = <code>[""DET"", ""NOUN"", [""VERB"", ""NOUN""], ""CONJ"", [""ADJ"", ""ADV"", ""NOUN""], ""ADV""]</code></p>

<p>I need the function to return each possible combination as a list of lists. So the return value for the above should be:</p>

 [""DET"", ""NOUN"", ""NOUN"", ""CONJ"", ""ADV"", ""ADV""],

Common Service Locator and implementations of IDependencyResolver,"<p>I'm building a library for <a href=""http://nlp.abodit.com"" rel=""nofollow"">conversational natural language processing</a>.  In many ways it acts much like MVC3 in that it has Controllers and Action Methods.  It also uses dependency injection in much the same way as MVC3 does when instantiating constructors for the Controller classes.  The main differences being that an English sentence replaces both the URL and the form values of HTTP; routing is based on matching sentence structure; and the parameters passed in are the meanings of words and phrases used in the English sentence.  </p>

<p>Currently it uses Autofac for Dependency Injection but I'd like to remove that dependency and allow callers to use any DI container.  </p>

If I use <code>IDependencyResolver</code> from MVC3 instead there are at least existing implementations of the mapping from the various DI container to that interface.</p>

<p>Should I:-</p>

<ol>
<li>use the Common Service Locator and force callers to implement the mapping classes.</li>
<li>use the MVC 3 <code>IDependencyResolver</code> interface which already has mappings to other containers.</li>
<li>accept a <code>object</code> as the dependency resolver and duck type it to get the one method I need from it so I can use the MVC3 interface without even taking a dependency on ASP.NET MVC3.</li>

Determining the Similarity Between Items in a Database,"<p>We have a database with hundreds of millions of records of log data. We're attempting to 'group' this log data as being likely to be of the same nature as other entries in the log database. For instance:</p>

<p>Record X may contain a log entry like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change Transaction ABC123 Assigned To Server US91</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And Record Y may contain a log entry like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Change Transaction XYZ789 Assigned To Server GB47</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To us humans those two log entries are easily recognizable as being likely related in some way. Now, there may be 10 million rows between Record X and Record Y. And there may be thousands of other entries that are similar to X and Y, and some that are totally different but that have other records they are similar to.</p>

<p>What I'm trying to determine is the best way to group the similar items together and say that with XX% certainty Record X and Record Y are probably of the same nature. Or perhaps a better way of saying it would be that the system would look at Record Y and say based on your content you're most like Record X as apposed to all other records.</p>

<p>I've seen some mentions of Natural Language Processing and other ways to find similarity between strings (like just brute-forcing some Levenshtein calculations) - however for us we have these two additional challenges:</p>

<ol>
<li>The content is machine generated - not human generated</li>
<li>As opposed to a search engine approach where we determine results for a given query - we're trying to classify a giant repository and group them by how alike they are to one another.</li>

Incrementally Trainable Entity Recognition Classifier,"<p>I'm doing some semantic-web/nlp research, and I have a set of sparse records, containing a mix of numeric and non-numeric data, representing entities labeled with various features extracted from simple English sentences.</p>

</code></pre>

<p>A single entity may appear more than once (but with a different UID each time), and may have overlapping features with its other occurrences. A second data set represents which of the above UIDs are definitely the same.</p>

<p>e.g.</p>

09834502|294234234,sd09f8098
...
</code></pre>

<p>What algorithm(s) would I use to <strong>incrementally</strong> train a classifier that could take a set of features, and instantly recommend the N most similar UIDs and probability of whether or not those UIDs actually represent the <strong>same</strong> entity? Optionally, I'd also like to get a recommendation of missing features to populate and then re-classify to get a more certain matches.</p>

<p>I researched traditional approximate nearest neighbor algorithms. such as <a href=""http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~mariusm/index.php/FLANN/FLANN"" rel=""nofollow"">FLANN</a> and <a href=""http://pypi.python.org/pypi/scikits.ann"" rel=""nofollow"">ANN</a>, and I don't think these would be appropriate since they're not trainable (in a supervised learning sense) nor are they typically designed for sparse non-numeric input.</p>

<p>As a very naive first-attempt, I was thinking about using a naive bayesian classifier, by converting each SameAs relation into a set of training samples. So, for each entity A with B sameas relations, I would iterate over each and train the classifier like:</p>

<pre><code>classifier = Classifier()
for entity,sameas_entities in sameas_dataset:
    entity_features = get_features(entity)
    for other_entity in sameas_entities:
        other_entity_features = get_features(other_entity)
        classifier.train(cls=entity, ['left_'+f for f in entity_features] + ['right_'+f for f in other_entity_features])
        classifier.train(cls=other_entity, ['left_'+f for f in other_entity_features] + ['right_'+f for f in entity_features])
</code></pre>

<p>And then use it like:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; print classifier.findSameAs(dict(speaker=997, session=8945305, sentence=32, obj_called='salty',isa='cat',eats='mice'), n=7)
[(1.0, '23432424'),(0.999, 'io43po5', (1.0, '2l3jk42'), (1.0, 'sdf90s8df'), (0.76, 'jerwljk'), (0.34, 'rlekwj32424'), (0.08, '09843jlk')]
&gt;&gt;&gt; print classifier.findSameAs(dict(isa='cat',eats='mice'), n=7)
[(0.09, '23432424'), (0.06, 'jerwljk'), (0.03, 'rlekwj32424'), (0.001, '09843jlk')]

Brute-Force language detection,"<p>I need an algorithm (any programming language) to test the vitality with an hill climbing algorithm for breaking a cipher for a crypto challenge.

<p>An enigma M4 crypto project ( <a href=""http://www.bytereef.org/m4_project.html"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.bytereef.org/m4_project.html</a> ) uses the Sinkov statistics, which I want to use, too.</p>

Looking for a way to optimize this algorithm for parsing a very large string,"<p>The following class parses through a very large string (an entire novel of text) and breaks it into consecutive 4-character strings that are stored as a Tuple. Then each tuple can be assigned a probability based on a calculation. I am using this as part of a monte carlo/ genetic algorithm to train the program to recognize a language based on syntax only (just the character transitions). </p>

<p>I am wondering if there is a faster way of doing this. It takes about 400ms to look up the probability of any given 4-character tuple. The relevant method _Probablity() is at the end of the class. </p>

<p>This is a computationally intensive problem related to another post of mine: <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7423279/algorithm-for-computing-the-plausibility-of-a-function-monte-carlo-method"">Algorithm for computing the plausibility of a function / Monte Carlo Method</a></p>

<p>Ultimately I'd like to store these values in a 4d-matrix. But given that there are 26 letters in the alphabet that would be a HUGE task. (26x26x26x26). If I take only the first 15000 characters of the novel then performance improves a ton, but my data isn't as useful. </p>

<p>Here is the method that parses the text 'source':</p>

<pre><code>    private List&lt;Tuple&lt;char, char, char, char&gt;&gt; _Parse(string src)
    {
        var _map = new List&lt;Tuple&lt;char, char, char, char&gt;&gt;(); 

        for (int i = 0; i &lt; src.Length - 3; i++)
        {
          int j = i + 1;
          int k = i + 2;
          int l = i + 3;

          _map.Add
            (new Tuple&lt;char, char, char, char&gt;(src[i], src[j], src[k], src[l])); 
        }

        return _map; 
    }
</code></pre>

<p>And here is the _Probability method:</p>

<pre><code>    private double _Probability(char x0, char x1, char x2, char x3)
    {
        var subset_x0 = map.Where(x =&gt; x.Item1 == x0);

<p><b>EDIT</b> - I'm providing more details to clear things up,</p>

<p>1) Strictly speaking I've only worked with English so far, but its true that different alphabets will have to be considered. Currently I only want the program to recognize English, similar to whats described in this paper: <a href=""http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">http://www-stat.stanford.edu/~cgates/PERSI/papers/MCMCRev.pdf</a></p>

<p>2) I am calculating the probabilities of n-tuples of characters where n &lt;= 4. For instance if I am calculating the total probability of the string ""that"", I would break it down into these independent tuples and calculate the probability of each individually first:</p>

<p>[t][h] </p>

<p>[t][h][a]</p>

<p>[t][h][a][t]</p>

<p>[t][h] is given the most weight, then [t][h][a], then [t][h][a][t]. Since I am not just looking at the 4-character tuple as a single unit, I wouldn't be able to just divide the instances of [t][h][a][t] in the text by the total no. of 4-tuples in the next. </p>

<p>The value assigned to each 4-tuple can't overfit to the text, because by chance many real English words may never appear in the text and they shouldn't get disproportionally low scores. Emphasing first-order character transitions (2-tuples) ameliorates this issue. Moving to the 3-tuple then the 4-tuple just refines the calculation. </p>

<p>I came up with a Dictionary that simply tallies the count of how often the tuple occurs in the text (similar to what Vilx suggested), rather than repeating identical tuples which is a waste of memory. That got me from about ~400ms per lookup to about ~40ms per, which is a pretty great improvement. I still have to look into some of the other suggestions, however. </p>

Where can I find texts that describe topic-specific events? ,"<p>So, some background: I'm trying to train a ML system to answer questions about events, where both the event descriptions and questions are posed in natural language; the event descriptions are constrained to being single sentences.</p>

<p>So far the main problem with this has been locating a corpus that describes events with a limited enough vocabulary to pose similar questions across all of the events (e.g. if all of the events involved chess, I could reasonably ask 'what piece moved?' and an answer could be drawn from a decent percentage of the event description sentences).  </p>

<p>With that in mind, I'm hoping to find a text source that is tightly focused around describing events within some fairly limited topic (more along the lines of chess commentary than a chess forum, for example). </p>

<p>While I've had some luck with a corpus of <a href=""http://www.ldc.upenn.edu/Catalog/byType.jsp"" rel=""nofollow"">air-traffic controller dialogs</a>, most of sentences aren't typical English (they involve a lot of Charlie, Tango, etc.). However, if the format is as I've described then the actual topic of focus is irrelevant, so long as it has one.</p>

<p>Since I plan on building my own corpus out of this text, no tagging is necessary. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fossil fuels are fuels formed by natural processes such as anaerobic
  decomposition of buried dead organisms. The age of the organisms and
  their resulting fossil fuels is typically millions of years, and
  sometimes exceeds 650 million years. The fossil fuels, which contain
  high percentages of carbon, include coal, petroleum, and natural gas.
  Fossil fuels range from volatile materials with low carbon:hydrogen
  ratios like methane, to liquid petroleum to nonvolatile materials
  composed of almost pure carbon, like anthracite coal. Methane can be
  found in hydrocarbon fields, alone, associated with oil, or in the
  form of methane clathrates. It is generally accepted that they formed
  from the fossilized remains of dead plants by exposure to heat and
  pressure in the Earth's crust over millions of years. This biogenic
  theory was first introduced by Georg Agricola in 1556 and later by
  Mikhail Lomonosov in the 18th century.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Second:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Fossil fuel reforming is a method of producing hydrogen or other
  useful products from fossil fuels such as natural gas. This is
  achieved in a processing device called a reformer which reacts steam
  at high temperature with the fossil fuel. The steam methane reformer
  is widely used in industry to make hydrogen. There is also interest in
  the development of much smaller units based on similar technology to
  produce hydrogen as a feedstock for fuel cells. Small-scale steam
  reforming units to supply fuel cells are currently the subject of
  research and development, typically involving the reforming of
  methanol or natural gas but other fuels are also being considered such
  as propane, gasoline, autogas, diesel fuel, and ethanol.</p>

Parsing Natural Language Music Citations Using Regex,"<p>I am struggling with nailing down a fairly complex regular expression to parse song titles with optional artist attribution from loosely-typed English.

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = that's what i'm not</li>

<li><code>\2</code> not matched</li>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am, that's what i'm not</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = arctic monkeys</li>
</ul>
<p>Single quotes should work too, but obviously not if they appear within the title:</p>
<blockquote>

</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = whatever people say i am, that</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = s what i'm not'</li>

<p>Additionally, if quotes are in use, the word &quot;by&quot; or a comma are optional:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;down by the bay&quot; raffi</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li><code>\1</code> = down by the bay</li>
<li><code>\2</code> = raffi</li>

<p>However, if there are no quotes, and more than one &quot;by&quot;, then only the last &quot;by&quot; should be used as a delimiter:</p>

<p>I tried training the classifier and got good results: F1 score was 0.94 without head mark and 0.93 with it. I think it is OK. The problem is that the OpenNLP chunker API does not support this mark and gets confused while creating the spans. I changed the OpenNLP code to handle it and I was wondering if it is a good patch, but since it is not common I should not send the patch.</p>

<p>What I am trying to do is to identify what the problem was so in this case, <code>set-top box</code> and whether the action that was taken resolved the problem so in this case, <code>yes</code> because restarting fixed the problem. So if all the sentences were of this form, my life would have been easier but because it is natural language, the sentences could also be of the following form:</p>

<p><code>I took a look at the car and found nothing wrong with it. However, I suspect there is something wrong with the engine</code></p>

<p>So in this case, the problem was with the <code>car</code>. The action taken did not resolve the problem because of the presence of the word <code>suspect</code>. And the potential problem could be with the <code>engine</code>.</p>

<p>I am not looking for an absolute answer as I suspect this is very complex. What I am looking for is more rather a high-level overview that will point me in the right direction. If there is an easier/alternate way to do this, that is welcome as well.</p>

Text Game Commands Parsing?,"<p>I'm interested in writing a parsing engine such as the ones in Inform, which is very robust.</p>

<p>I've tried a couple of different approach: </p>

<ul>
<li>regex. For regex, I can only match <code>{verb} {noun1 optional-noun2} {optional-preposition} {indirect-noun1 optional-indirect-noun2}</code> This doesn't work that well.</li>
<li>list of predefined verbs and their matched preposition and nouns. This approach is too complex, since there has to be A LOT of predefined data.</li>
<li>splitting into different words and run them through a dictionary maps. Again this is too complex and not practical due to the amiguity of certain words such as ""look"" or ""put (on, out)""</li>

Book translation data format,"<p>I'm thinking of translating a book from English to my native language. I can translate just fine, and I'm happy with <code>vim</code> as a text editor. My problem is that I'd like to somehow preserve the semantics, i.e. which parts of my translation correspond to the original.</p>

<p>I could basically create a simple XML-based markup language, that'd look something like</p>

<pre><code>&lt;book&gt;
  &lt;chapter&gt;
    &lt;paragraph&gt;
      &lt;sentence&gt;
        &lt;original&gt;This is an example sentence.&lt;/original&gt;
        &lt;translation lang=""fi""&gt;Tämä on esimerkkilause.&lt;/translation&gt;
      &lt;/sentence&gt;
    &lt;/paragraph&gt;
  &lt;/chapter&gt;
&lt;/book&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>Now, that would probably have its benefits but I don't think editing that would be very fun.</p>

<p>Another possibility that I can think of would be to keep the original and translation in separate files. If I add a newline after each translation chunk and keep line numbering consistent, editing would be easy and I'd be able to programmatically match the original and translation.</p>

<pre><code>original.txt:
  This is an example sentence.
  In this format editing is easy.

translation-fi.txt:
  Tämä on esimerkkilause.
  Tässä muodossa muokkaaminen on helppoa.
</code></pre>

<p>However, this doesn't seem very robust. It would be easy to mess up. Probably someone has better ideas. Thus the question:</p>

<p><strong>What would be the best data format for making a book translation with a text editor?</strong></p>

<p>EDIT: added tag <code>vim</code>, since I'd prefer to do this with vim and believe that some vim guru might have ideas.</p>

<p>EDIT2: started a bounty on this. I'm currently leaning to the second idea I describe, but I hope to get something about as easy to edit (and quite easy to implement) but more robust.</p>

Searching Natural Language Sentence Structure,"<p>What's the best way to store and search a database of natural language sentence structure  trees?</p>

<p>Using <a href=""http://incubator.apache.org/opennlp/"" rel=""noreferrer"">OpenNLP's</a> English Treebank Parser, I can get fairly reliable sentence structure parsings for arbitrary sentences. What I'd like to do is create a tool that can extract all the doc strings from my source code, generate these trees for all sentences in the doc strings, store these trees and their associated function name in a database, and then allow a user to search the database using natural language queries.</p>

<p>So, given the sentence <code>""This uploads files to a remote machine.""</code> for the function <code>upload_files()</code>, I'd have the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(TOP
  (S
    (NP (DT This))
    (VP
      (VBZ uploads)
      (NP (NNS files))
      (PP (TO to) (NP (DT a) (JJ remote) (NN machine))))
    (. .)))
</code></pre>

<p>If someone entered the query ""How can I upload files?"", equating to the tree:</p>

<pre><code>(TOP
  (SBARQ
    (WHADVP (WRB How))
    (SQ (MD can) (NP (PRP I)) (VP (VB upload) (NP (NNS files))))
    (. ?)))
</code></pre>

<p>how would I store and query these trees in a SQL database?</p>

<p>I've written a simple proof-of-concept script that can perform this search using a mix of regular expressions and network graph parsing, but I'm not sure how I'd implement this in a  scalable way.</p>

<p>And yes, I realize my example would be trivial to retrieve using a simple keyword search. The idea I'm trying to test is how I might take advantage of grammatical structure, so I can weed-out entries with similar keywords, but a different sentence structure. For example, with the above query, I wouldn't want to retrieve the entry associated with the sentence <code>""Checks a remote machine to find a user that uploads files.""</code> which has similar keywords, but is obviously describing a completely different behavior.</p>

Apostrophes Converted to Correct Text?,"<p>Goal:  I need to be able to convert apostrophes to properly formed words. - at least for the most common words with apostrophes.  To do this ideally I'd want a list of words and their implied conterparts (i.e. ""don't"" and ""do not"").  </p>

<p>Issue: I'm creating a search algorithm based on natural language processing, but when users create content (or search) using an apostrophe, it causes issues for us.  Mostly because if we were to simply remove the apostrophe we would have (don't -> dont) (doesn't -> doesnt), which officially is not an english word, and can't be translated by the NLP system.</p>

<p>The ideal solution is simply a one to one mapping of what these items should be converted to, but I'm unaware of such a list.</p>

Get the word under the mouse cursor in Windows,"<p>Greetings everyone,</p>

<p>A friend and I are discussing the possibility of a new project: A translation program that will pop up a translation whenever you hover over any word in any control, even static, non-editable ones.  I know there are many browser plugins to do this sort of thing on webpages; we're thinking about how we would do it system-wide (on Windows).</p>

<p>Of course, the key difficulty is figuring out the word the user is hovering over.  I'm aware of MSAA and Automation, but as far as I can tell, those things only allow you to get the entire contents of a control, not the specific word the mouse is over.</p>

<p>I stumbled upon this (proprietary) application that does pretty much exactly what we want to do:  <a href=""http://www.gettranslateit.com/"" rel=""nofollow"">http://www.gettranslateit.com/</a></p>

<p>Somehow they are able to get the exact word the user is hovering over in almost any application (It seems to have trouble in a few apps, notably Windows Explorer).  It even grabs text out of obviously custom-drawn controls, somehow.  At first I thought it must be using OCR.  But even when I shrink the font so far down that the text becomes a completely unreadable blob, it can still recognize words perfectly.  (And yet, it doesn't recognize anything if I change the font to Wingdings.  But maybe that's by design?)</p>

<p>Any ideas as to how it's achieving this seemingly impossible task?</p>

<p>EDIT: It doesn't work with Wingdings, but it does work with some other nonsense fonts, so I've confirmed it can't be OCR.</p>

What are the &quot;-P&quot;s in the Berkeley Aligner&#39;s output format?,"<p>I want to use the Berkeley Aligner for some MT research I'm doing, since, apparently, it beats GIZA++ pretty handily (a 32% alignment error reduction in some reported results).  For the most part the outputs in the Berkeley Aligner ""examples"" directory look like what Moses does to GIZA++ output files (i.e., paired aligned word indices), but there are some funny looking ""-P""s after certain pairs.  I can't for the life of me find any documentation  of what these ""-P"" annotations are supposed to signify (certainly not in the Berkeley Aligner ""documentation"" directory).</p>

<p>For clarity, I'll give a little illustrative example.  Suppose you have the sentences: ""Jean plâit à Marie"" and ""Marie likes Jean"".  French is the source language and English is the target language. The words ""Jean"" (indices 0 and 2, resp.) and ""Marie"" (indices 3 and 0, resp.) are aligned in both sentences, and ""plâit"" and ""à "" (French indices 1 and 2, resp.) are aligned with ""like"" (English index 1).  In Moses-post-processed GIZA++ output, this would be denoted by a list of source-target index pairs:</p>

<pre><code>0-2 1-1 2-1 3-0
</code></pre>

<p>Berkeley Aligner produces files that pretty much resemble this, but some index pairs have a -P on them (e.g., you <em>might</em> see something like 1-1-P).</p>

<p>What the heck does this mean? Can I safely remove these -P annotations and get a GIZA++-via-Moses style alignment, or should I be doing something more (e.g., multiplying them out into a series of aligned index pairs, or what have you)?</p>

How to compare different language String values in JAVA?,"<p>In my web application I am using <strong>two</strong> different Languages namely <strong>English</strong> and <strong>Arabic</strong>.</p>

Justadistraction: tokenizing English without whitespaces. Murakami SheepMan,"<p>I wondered how <strong>you</strong> would go about tokenizing strings in English (or other western languages) if whitespaces were removed?</p>

<p>The inspiration for the question is the Sheep Man character in the Murakami novel '<a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_Dance_Dance"" rel=""noreferrer"">Dance Dance Dance</a>'</p>

<p>In the novel, the Sheep Man is translated as saying things like:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>""likewesaid, we'lldowhatwecan. Trytoreconnectyou, towhatyouwant,"" said the Sheep Man. ""Butwecan'tdoit-alone. Yougottaworktoo.""</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, some punctuation is kept, but not all. Enough for a human to read, but somewhat arbitrary.</p>

<p>What would be your strategy for building a parser for this? Common combinations of letters, syllable counts, conditional grammars, look-ahead/behind regexps etc.?</p>

<p>Specifically, python-wise, how would you structure a (forgiving) translation flow? Not asking for a completed answer, just more how your thought process would go about breaking the problem down.</p>

<p>I ask this in a frivolous manner, but I think it's a question that might get some interesting (nlp/crypto/frequency/social) answers.
Thanks!</p>

How can I make this Python2.6 function work with Unicode?,"<p>I've got this function, which I modified from material in chapter 1 of the online NLTK book. It's been very useful to me but, despite reading the chapter on Unicode, I feel just as lost as before.</p>

<pre><code>def openbookreturnvocab(book):
    fileopen = open(book)
    rawness = fileopen.read()
    tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(rawness)
    nltktext = nltk.Text(tokens)
    nltkwords = [w.lower() for w in nltktext]
    nltkvocab = sorted(set(nltkwords))
    return nltkvocab
</code></pre>

<p>When I tried it the other day on Also Sprach Zarathustra, it clobbered words with an umlat over the o's and u's. I'm sure some of you will know why that happened. I'm also sure that it's quite easy to fix. I know that it just has to do with calling a function that re-encodes the tokens into unicode strings. If so, that it seems to me it might not happen inside that function definition at all, but here, where I prepare to write to file:</p>

<pre><code>def jotindex(jotted, filename, readmethod):
    filemydata = open(filename, readmethod)
    jottedf = '\n'.join(jotted)
    filemydata.write(jottedf)
    filemydata.close()
    return 0
</code></pre>

<p>I heard that what I had to do was encode the string into unicode after reading it from the file. I tried amending the function like so:</p>

<pre><code>def openbookreturnvocab(book):
    fileopen = open(book)
    rawness = fileopen.read()
    unirawness = rawness.decode('utf-8')
    tokens = nltk.wordpunct_tokenize(unirawness)
    nltktext = nltk.Text(tokens)
    nltkwords = [w.lower() for w in nltktext]
    nltkvocab = sorted(set(nltkwords))
    return nltkvocab

Parser Generator or Library that Supports Suffix Agreement,"<p>I'm working on a syntactic parser for some language. But this language requires suffix agreement highly.

Transforming early modern English into 20th century spelling using the NLTK,"<p>I have a list of strings that are all early modern English words ending with 'th.' These include hath, appointeth, demandeth, etc. -- they are all conjugated for the third person singular.</p>

<p>As part of a much larger project (using my computer to convert the Gutenberg etext of Gargantua and Pantagruel into something more like 20th century English, so that I'll be able to read it more easily) I want to remove the last two or three characters from all of those words and replace them with an 's,' then use a slightly modified function on the words that still weren't modernized, both included below.</p>

<p>My main problem is that I just never manage to get my typing right in Python. I find that part of the language really confusing at this point.</p>

<p>Here's the function that removes th's:</p>

<pre><code>from __future__ import division
import nltk, re, pprint

def ethrema(word):
    if word.endswith('th'):
        return word[:-2] + 's'
</code></pre>

<p>Here's the function that removes extraneous e's:</p>

<pre><code>def ethremb(word):
    if word.endswith('es'):
        return word[:-2] + 's'
</code></pre>

<p>hence the words 'abateth' and 'accuseth' would pass through ethrema but not through ethremb(ethrema), while the word 'abhorreth' would need to pass through both.</p>

<p>If anyone can think of a more efficient way to do this, I'm all ears.</p>

<p>Here's the result of my very amateurish attempt to use these functions on a tokenized list  of words that need modernizing:</p>

<pre><code>&gt;&gt;&gt; eth1 = [w.ethrema() for w in text]
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File ""&lt;stdin&gt;"", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'ethrema'
</code></pre>

<p>So, yeah, it's really an issue of typing. These are the first functions I've ever written in Python, and I have no idea how to apply them to actual objects.</p>

Binarization in Natural Language Processing,"<p>Binarization is the act of transforming colorful features of of an entity into vectors of numbers, most often binary vectors, to make good examples for classifier algorithms.</p>

<p>If we where to binarize the sentence ""The cat ate the dog"", we could start by assigning every word an ID (for example cat-1, ate-2, the-3, dog-4) and then simply replace the word by it's ID giving the vector &lt;3,1,2,3,4>. </p>

<p>Given these IDs we could also create a binary vector by giving each word four possible slots, and setting the slot corresponding to a specific word with to one, giving the vector &lt;0,0,1,0,1,0,0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1>. The latter method is, as far as I know, is commonly referred to as the bag-of-words-method.</p>

<p>Now for my question, what is the <i>best</i> binarization method when it comes to describe features for natural language processing in general, and transition-based <i>dependency parsing</i> (with Nivres algorithm) in particular? </p>

<p>In this context, we do not want to encode the whole sentence, but rather the current state of the parse, for example the top word on the stack en the first word in the input queue. Since order is highly relevant, this rules out the bag-of-words-method. </p>

<p>With <i>best</i>, I am referring to the method that makes the data the most intelligible for the classifier, without using up unnecessary memory. For example I don't want a word bigram to use 400 million features for 20000 unique words, if only 2% the bigrams actually exist.</p>

<p>Since the answer is also depending on the particular classifier, I am mostly interested in maximum entropy models (liblinear), support vector machines (libsvm) and perceptrons, but answers that apply to other models are also welcome.</p>

You can simply type in a phrase like ""Dentist appointment monday at 2PM in WhateverPlace"" and it will parse it and fill all fields for you.</p>

<p>I don't have any kind of technical constraints since it's going to be a personal project but I'm more familiar with .NET world. Actually, I'm not sure this is a matter of language but if it's necessary I'm more than willing to learn a new language to do it.</p>

<p>My project is related to personal finances so the phrases are more like ""Spent 10USD on Coffee last night with my girlfriend"" and it would fill location, amount of $$$, tags and other stuff.</p>

<p>Thanks a lot for any kind of directions that you might give me!</p>

Theory: &quot;Lexical Encoding&quot;,"<p><strong>I am using the term ""Lexical Encoding"" for my lack of a better one.</strong></p>

<p>A Word is arguably the fundamental unit of communication as opposed to a Letter.  Unicode tries to assign a numeric value to each Letter of all known Alphabets.  What is a Letter to one language, is a Glyph to another.  Unicode 5.1 assigns more than 100,000 values to these Glyphs currently.  Out of the approximately 180,000 Words being used in Modern English, it is said that with a vocabulary of about 2,000 Words, you should be able to converse in general terms. A ""Lexical Encoding"" would encode each Word not each Letter, and encapsulate them within a Sentence.</p>

<pre><code>// An simplified example of a ""Lexical Encoding""
String sentence = ""How are you today?"";
int[] sentence = { 93, 22, 14, 330, QUERY };
</code></pre>

<p>In this example each Token in the String was encoded as an Integer. The Encoding Scheme here simply assigned an int value based on generalised statistical ranking of word usage, and assigned a constant to the question mark.</p>

<p>Ultimately, a Word has both a Spelling &amp; Meaning though.  Any ""Lexical Encoding"" would preserve the meaning and intent of the Sentence as a whole, and not be language specific.  An English sentence would be encoded into <a href=""https://stackoverflow.com/questions/170452/linguistics-lexical-encoding#174249"">""...language-neutral atomic elements of meaning ...""</a> which could then be reconstituted into any language with a structured Syntactic Form and Grammatical Structure.</p>

<p>What are other examples of ""Lexical Encoding"" techniques?</p>

Splitting string on probable English word boundaries,"<p>I recently used Adobe Acrobat Pro's OCR feature to process a Japanese kanji dictionary.

Hierarchy of meaning,"<p>I am looking for a method to build a hierarchy of words. </p>

<p>Background: I am a ""amateur"" natural language processing enthusiast and right now one of the problems that I am interested in is determining the hierarchy of word semantics from a group of words.</p>

<p>For example, if I have the set which contains a ""super"" representation of others, i.e.</p>

<pre><code>[cat, dog, monkey, animal, bird, ... ]
</code></pre>

<p>I am interested to use any technique which would allow me to extract the word 'animal' which has the most meaningful and accurate representation of the other words inside this set.</p>

<p>Note: they are NOT the same in meaning. cat != dog != monkey != animal
BUT cat is a subset of animal and dog is a subset of animal.</p>

<p>I know by now a lot of you will be telling me to use wordnet. Well, I will try to but I am actually interested in doing a very domain specific area which WordNet doesn't apply because:
1) Most words are not found in Wordnet
2) All the words are in another language; translation is possible but is to limited effect.</p>

<p>another example would be:</p>

<pre><code>[ noise reduction, focal length, flash, functionality, .. ]
</code></pre>

<p>so functionality includes everything in this set. </p>

<p>I have also tried crawling wikipedia pages and applying some techniques on td-idf etc but wikipedia pages doesn't really do much either.</p>

<p>Can someone possibly enlighten me as to what direction my research should go towards? (I could use anything)</p>

English Lexicon for Search Query Correction,"<p>I'm building a spelling corrector for search engine queries by implementing the method described in ""<a href=""http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/silviu/emnlp04.pdf"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">Spelling correction as an iterative process that exploits the collective knowledge of web users</a>"".  </p>

<p>The high-level approach is as follows:  for a given query, come up with possible correction candidates (words in the query log within a certain edit distance) of each unigram and bigram, then perform a modified Viterbi search to find the most likely sequence of candidates given bigram frequencies.  Repeat this process until the sequence is of maximum probability.</p>

<p>The modification to the Viterbi search is such that if two adjacent words are both found in a trusted lexicon, at most one can be corrected.  This is especially important for avoiding correction of properly-spelled single-word queries to words of higher frequency.</p>

<p>My question is where to find such a lexicon.  It should be in English and contain proper nouns (first/last names, places, brand names, etc) likely to show up in search queries as well as common and uncommon English words.  Even a push in the right direction would be useful.</p>

<p>Also, if anyone is reading this and has any suggestions for improvement on the methodology supplied in the paper, I am open to those as well given that this is my first foray into NLP.</p>

Natural Language CFG builder Algorithm,"<p>I am working in a natural language processing project. It aims to build libraries for Arabic language. We working on a POS tagger and now I am thinking in grammar phase. Since Arabic language and many others have complicated grammar, so it is very hard to build their context free grammar (CFG). For this reason I had an idea for an algorithm to build a CFG (with probability PCFG) for any language from a tagger corpora using unsupervised learning. To explain the algorithm suppose I have these three tagged statements as an input:
1- Verb Noun
2- Verb Noun Subject
3- Verb Noun Subject adverb
The algorithm gives:
1) A--> Verb Noun
2) B-->A Subject
3) C-->B adverb.<br/>
We repeat this methodology for each statement such that we can finish with a specific PCFG. The main power of the algorithm lies beyond the fact of seeing the whole statement, so the probabilities can be conditional and they are specific. After that CKY algorithm can be applied to choose the best tree for new statements using probabilities.
Do you expect that this algorithm is good or not and does it worth to continue improving it.</p>

""fish""
""C++""</p>

<p>Verb:
""rules""
""fly""
""swim""</p>

<p>Article:
""the""</p>

<p>Writing the grammar was simple. It's implementing the code that is giving me some trouble. My psuedocode for it is:</p>

<pre><code>main()
get user input (string words;)
while loop (cin &gt;&gt; words)
call sentence()
end main()

sentence()
call noun()
if noun() call verb() (if verb is true return ""OK"" ???)(else ""not ok""???)
else if not noun() call article()
                if article() call sentence() (if sentence is true ""OK""???)(else ""not""?)
else if not noun() call conjunction()
                   if sentence() conjunction() sentence() - no idea how to implement
                                                             return ""OK""
else ""not ok""
</code></pre>

<p>So there is my extremely sloppy psuedo code. I have a few questions on implementing it.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>For the word functions (noun, verb, etc.) how should I go about checking if they are true? (as in checking if the user's input has birds, fish, fly, swim, etc.)</p></li>
<li><p>How should I handle the conjunction call and the output?</p></li>
<li><p>Should I handle the output from the main function or the call functions?</p></li>
<li><p>None of the above questions matter if my psuedo code is completely wrong. Is there anything wrong with the basics?</p></li>
</ol>

<p>As an added note, I'm on a Chapter 6 exercise of Programming: Practice and Principles Using C++ so I'd prefer to use language syntax that I've already learned, so anything that falls into the category of advanced programming probably isn't very helpful. (The exercise specifically says not to use tokens, so count those out.)</p>

<p>Thanks in advance</p>

<p>Last Edit: In the book's public group I asked the same question and Bjarne Stroustrup commented back saying he put the exercise solution online. He basically had the input read into the sentence function and used if statements to return true or false. However, he didn't use articles so mine was much more complex. I guess if I've learned anything from this exercise its that when dealing with a lot of user input, tokenization is key (from what I know so far.) Here is my code for now. I may go back to it later because it is still very buggy and basically only returns if the sentence is OK and can't handle things like (noun, conjunction, sentence), but for now I'm moving on.</p>

Multi layer perceptron for OCR,"<p>I intend to use a multi layer perceptron network trained with backpropagation (one hidden layer, inputs served as 8x8 bit matrices containing the B/W pixels from the image). The following questions arise:</p>

<ol>
<li>which type of learning should I use: batch or on-line?</li>
<li>how could I estimate the right number of nodes in the hidden layer? I intend to process the 26 letter of english alphabet.</li>
<li>how could I stop the training process, to avoid overfitting?</li>
<li>(not quite related) is there another better NN prved to perform better than MLP? I know about MLP stucking in local minima, overfitting and so on, so is there a better (soft computing-based) approach?</li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks</p>

Rhyme in PHP,"<p>I am having a hard time to find a way to detect if <strong>two words has the same rhyme in English</strong>. It has not to be the same syllabic ending but something closer to <strong>phonetically similarity</strong>. </p>

<p>I can not believe in 2009 the only way of doing it is using those old fashioned rhyme dictionaries. Do you know any resources (in PHP would be a plus) to help me in this painful task?</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>Your hints were all really hepful. I will take some time to investigate it. Anyway, more info about DoubleMetaPhone can be found <a href=""http://swoodbridge.com/DoubleMetaPhone/"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">here in a proper PHP code</a> (the other one is an extension).
There are interesting information about MethaPhone function and doublemetaphone <a href=""http://es2.php.net/metaphone"" rel=""nofollow noreferrer"">in Php.net</a>.</p>

<p>They specially alert about how slow double metaphone is compared with metaphone (something like 100 times slower).</p>

Can anyone point me at a good example of pretty printing rules to &quot;english&quot;,"<p>I've got the equivalent of an AST that a user has built using a rule engine.  But when displaying a list of the rules, I'd like to be able to ""pretty print"" each rule into something that looks nice**.  Internally when represented as a string they look like s-expressions so imagine something like:</p>

<pre><code>(and (contains ""foo"" ""foobar"") (equals 4 (plus 2 2 )))
</code></pre>

<p>Can anyone point me at a program that has done a good job of displaying rules in a readable fashion?</p>

<p>** Needs to be localizable too, but I guess we'll leave that for extra credit.</p>
